Judgment :-This is a plaintiffs&#x27; appeal arising out of a suit for daclaration and possession. Certain persons claiming to be representatives of a Shamlat Committee brought the suit against a number of defendants with the following allegations, Plot Nos. 7337, 7333, 7339, 7340 and 7341 with a total area of 6 Bighas and 6 Biswas were the property of the Shamlat Committee. In 1913 the plaintiffs filed an application for ejectment against two persons, Sualal and Nanda. The application for ejectment was allowed subject to payment of Rs. 828. Two persons, Bhola and Mangla purchased certain land from Nanda and others, and thereby stepped into the shoes of Sualal and Nanda. The plaintiffs permitted Bhola and Mangla to remain in possession of the land in dispute as tenants-at- will of the Shamlat Committee. The defendants are legal representatives of Bhola and Mangla. The defendants subsequently stopped paying rent to the Committee. Bhola and Mangla applied to the Revenue Authorities for mutation of their names as owners of the plots in dispute. This request was granted. The Tehsildar passed an order of mutation in favour of Bhola and Mangla on 4-9-1931. The plaintiffs therefore brought the suit for a declaration that, the mutation order passed by the Tehsildar on 4-9-1931 was erroneous. The plaintiffs also claimed possession of the five plots in dispute. The claim was resisted by the defendants. They denied the title of the plaintiffs. The defendants pleaded that, they were owners of the plots in dispute. There was also a plea of adverse possession. All these pleas raised in defence were repelled by the learned Second Additional Sub-Judge. </p><p>The Court therefore passed a decree in favour of the plaintiffs for a declaration and possession upon payment of Rs. 828. Against this decree of the trial Court an appeal was filed by Mohan Lal defendant. The learned Additional District Judge accepted the plea of adverse possession set up by the defendants, allowed the appeal and dismissed the plaintiffs&#x27; suit. Hence this second appeal by the plaintiffs. </p><p>2. The plaintiffs claimed two reliefs in the plaint. The first relief was for a declaration that, the order of mutation dated 4-9-1931 was erroneous. The plaint was filed on 3-7-1937. It was urged on behalf of the defendants that, the claim for declaration was barred by time. The defendants relied upon Art. 14, Limitation Act. Article 14 governs suits to set aside any act or order of an officer of Government in his official capacity. The period of limitation is one year. The plaintiffs rely upon the residuary Art. 120, under which the period of limitation is six years. In Onkarlal v. Shaligram, AIR (9) 1922 Nag 76 : (5 NLR 199), it was held that, in the matter of limitation a suit under S. 83, C. P. Land Revenue Act, for the amendment of Settlement entries is governed by Art. 14, Limitation Act. Article 14 governs suits for cancellation of certain orders. A suit for a mere declaration will not be governed by Art. 14. In Gangu v. Maharaj Das AIR (21) 1934 Lah 384 : (15 Lah 389 FB) it was held by a </p><p><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/></p><p>Full Bench of the Lahore High Court that, if it is necessary for a plaintiff to get rid of an order made by officer of the Government which stands in his way before be can obtain a certain relief and in order to obtain that relief he does not expressly ask for the setting aside of the order but merely for a declaratory decree, still the suit should be deemed to be one to set aside an order falling within Art. 14. In the present case although the plaintiffs&#x27; suit was for a declaration, their main relief was for possession. The plaintiffs might have succeeded in their claim for possession even in the presence of incorrect entries in the mutation register. It was not necessary for plaintiffs to apply for cancellation of the mutation entry. In my opinion the claim for declaration is governed by Art. 120, and not by Art. 14, Limitation Act. The suit was filed within 6 years from the date of mutation order. The claim for declaration was within limitation. </p><p>3. The main question involved in the appeal relates to adverse possession. Exhibit P&#x2F;9 is a copy of the ejectment order passed by the Revenue Officer on 31-1-1913. The order directs the ejectment of the defendants subject to the payment of a sum of Rs. 828 by the plaintiffs within a month. It is common ground that, the plaintiff did not deposit Rs. 828 as directed by the order dated 31-1-1913, and Sualal and Nanda were note ejected through Court. An appeal against the ejectment order was dismissed on 25-8-1913. In Akbar Ali v. Abdul Aziz, 58 IC 96 : (AIR (7) 1920 Bom 61) it was held by the Bombay High Court that, it would require very strong evidence on the part of a losing party to acquire a fresh title by adverse possession against the decree of a Court, and he must act in such a way that the parties interested could have no doubt whatever with regard to his motives in order that they might be enabled to take proper steps to stop time from running. In Kirpa Ram v. Muhammad Zahur Din, AIR (19) 1932 Lah 46 : (13 Lah 311) the defendant denied the title of the plaintiff in a suit for ejectment. There was a conditional decree for possession. It was held that, the failure to execute the decree made the possession of the defendant adverse to the plaintiff. The facts of the present case are similar. There was a conditional decree for ejectment passed in 1913. But that decree of ejectment was not executed. We may therefore assume that, Sualal and Nanda continued in adverse possession from 1913. </p><p>4. It is common ground that, Mangla and Bhola stepped into the shoes of Sualal and Nanda. Exhibit P-2 is an application presented by Bhola and Mangala to the Commissioner, Ajmer, for the grant of a patta with respect to the five plots in dispute. In the printed record the date of Ex. P-2 is given as 18-9-1928. But the original record shows that, the correct date of Ex. P-2 is 18-12-1922. In this application Ex. P-2 Bhola and Mangla clearly admitted that the land belonged to Shamlat Deh. Ajmer. There was a prayer for a patta from the Shamlat Deh. So assuming that Bhola and Mangla were in adverse possession in 1914 and subsequent years, they admitted the title of the Shamlat Committee in the year 1922. </p><p>5. The plaintiffs produced some evidence to show that, Mangla and Bhola used to pay rent to the plaintiffs. Two receipts Exs. P-1 and P-5 were relied upon. It has been found that, receipt Ex. P.1 does not relate to the land in dispute, while the receipt Ex. P-5 is suspicious. The learned Additional District Judge appears to have held that, Mangla and Bhola never paid rent to the plaintiffs. This finding may be accepted in second appeal. </p><p>6. In 1931 Mangla and Bhola applied for mutation on the footing that, they were owners of the land in dispute. The Tehsildar granted mutation. This was a clear plea of ownership of the land. There is </p><p><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/></p><p>no indication of a plea of adverse possession by Mangla and Bhola before 1931. The present suit was brought in 1937. Thus the defendants succeeded in establishing </p><p>adverse possession for a period of six years only. The claim for possession is not barred by Art. 144, Limitation Act. </p><p>7. In Sangamlal v. Ganga Din, AIR (33) 1946 All 389 : (ILR (1946) All 178) the plaintiff filed a suit for possession of a certain house in 1940. It was alleged in the plaint that, defendants had been in the occupation of the house as plaintiff&#x27;s tenants. The Court found that, the plaintiff had succeeded in proving his title to the house. It was further found that, defendants had been in uninterrupted possession of the house since 1918, and that the plaintiff&#x27;s allegation that, defendants had paid rent to him was false. The Court found that, defendants were not tenants of the plaintiff, as the house was never let out to the defendants. It was held that, as a matter of fact, the allegations made in the plaint amounted to an allegation that the plaintiff had been dispossessed. In view of the pleadings and the findings arrived at, Art. 142, Limitation Act, was applicable to the case. So the suit was barred by limitation, and the question of the defendants&#x27; adverse possession did not arise. </p><p>8. In the present case the Shamlat Committee obtained a declaration of their title in the year 1913. Sualal and Nanda were in adverse possession for some time. But they were not in adverse possession for as much as 12 years. So they could not perfect their title by adverse possession for 12 years. Bhola and Mangla stepped into the shoes of Sualal and Nanda. In the year 1922, Bhola and Mangla admitted the plaintiffs&#x27; title. The application for Patta amounted to an admission that, the Shamlat Committee was is constructive possession as proprietor. This position was not challenged by Bhola and Mangla till 1931. We must therefore assume that, the Shamlat Committee remained in constructive possession as proprietor up to 1931. Mangla, and Bhola set up an adverse title in 1931. The suit was filed by the plaintiffs in 1937. In this way the plaintiffs have been able to prove their constructive possession as proprietor within 6 or 7 years before the institution of this suit. So the claim for possession is not barred either under Art. 142 or under Art. 144, Limitation Act. </p><p>9. Another point raised on behalf of the defendants is that, the suit was not properly instituted. Originally the suit was instituted by Shamlat Committee Thok Maliyan, Ajmer, through its President Mr. Kishen Lal, Advocate and Lachami Narain number. Subsequently the plaint was amended. There was an application under O. 1, R. 8, Civil P. C. for permission to file the suit in a representative capacity. That application is paper No. 106 of the trial Court. </p><p>10. In Ahmed Sayad v. Bashir Ahmed, AIR (36) 1949 All 215 : (1948 OWN 397) it was held that, the Panches of a Beradari altogether (although ?) authorized by the Beradari to sue on its behalf, cannot </p><p><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/></p><p>maintain a suit to recover possession of property belonging to the Beradari without the permission of the Court and without observing the formalities prescribed by O. 1, R. 8, Civil P. C. Similarly in 1941 AMLJ 14 it was held by this Court that, Shamlat Committee is not a legally constituted corporation either by prescription or by operation of law. It seems to be some kind of representative body of khewatdars of a village. That being the case, before a suit can be brought all the khewatdars must join together in the institution of such a suit. </p><p>11. n the present case it was conceded on behalf of the appellants that, all the khewatdars of Thok Maliyan are interested in the land in dispute. It was therefore necessary to bring the suit on behalf of all the khewatdars. It is true that, an attempt was made to bring the suit on behalf of Shamlat Committee under O. 1, R. 8, Civil P. C. But this is not a suit representing all the khewatdars of Thok Maliyan. The suit must therefore fail on this preliminary ground </p><p>12. The suit as framed is defective under O. 1, R. 8, Civil P. C. The plaintiff&#x27;s suit has therefore to be dismissed. The appeal fails and is dismissed with costs. </p><p style=\"text-align:right\">Appeal Dismissed . </p><p><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:right\"><br/></p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><br/></p>', '<article><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;font-weight:700;margin:10px;margin-bottom:16px\" text=\"1111\">AIR 1951 BOMBAY 1\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight:600;margin-bottom:20px\">BOMBAY HIGH COURT\\n(Principal Seat at BOMBAY)\\nBHAGWATI , J. and DIXIT , J.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-weight:600\">S.

Bhagwati, J. :-An interesting question of Hindu law arises in these two appeals, whether the sons\\nare liable by reason of their pious obligation to pay the father\\'s debt incurred as a surety for payment\\nof money, out of their interest in the joint family properties.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">2. Defendant 4 is the father of plaintiffs 1 and 2. He had stood surety for the repayment of the debt due\\nby defendant 3, the debtor, to defendant 2, the creditor. He had executed a surety bond for repayment\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of the debt due by defendant 3 to defendant 2. Defendant 3 failed and neglected to pay the debt due\\nby him to defendant 2 and defendant 2 filed a suit, being suit No. 223 of 1938 against defendant\\n3, the principal debtor, and defendant 4, the surety. A decree was obtained by defendant 2 in that\\nsuit and he applied for execution of the decree against defendant 4 by darkhast No. 383 of 1941. In\\nexecution of that decree, the suit lands being the joint family properties belonging to the joint Hindu\\nfamily constituted by plaintiffs 1 and 2 and defendant 4 were attached. The auction sale was held on\\n19-2-1943, and defendant 2 purchased the suit lands. Defendant 2 obtained possession of the suit lands\\non 31-3-1945. Two suits were filed by the parties, each against the other. Suit No. 244 of 1945 was\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">filed by defendant 2 and his tenant to obtain a perpetual injunction restraining plaintiffs 1 and 2 from\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">interfering with their possession and enjoyment of the suit lands. Suit No. 309 of 1945 was filed by\\nplaintiffs 1 and 2 against defendant 2 and his tenant, their father defendant 4, and the debtor defendant\\n3, for a perpetual injunction restraining defendants 1 and 2 from interfering with their possession and\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">enjoyment of the suit lands. Both these suits were tried together, a common question of law and fact\\narising therein, and the trial Court came to the conclusion that the auction sale was not binding on\\nplaintiffs 1 and 2, that plaintiffs 1 and 2 were in possession of the suit lands and granted an injunction\\nagainst defendants 1 and 2. The appeal Court reversed this decision holding that the auction sale was\\nbinding on plaintiffs 1 and 2 and that they were not in possession of the suit lands. The appeal Court\\nthus dismissed the suit of plaintiffs 1 and 2. An appeal was filed by plaintiffs 1 and 2 against this\\ndecision of the appeal Court. The appeal which was filed from the decision of the appeal Court in suit\\nNo. 309 of 1945 was S. a. No. 776 of 1948 and the appeal which was filed from the decision of the\\nappeal Court in Suit No. 244 of 1945 was S. A. No. 847 of 1948. Both these second appeals were\\nheard together again for the same reason that a common question of law and fact arose in both of them.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">3. These second appeals came on for hearing before Dixit J. sitting singly and in so far as he thought\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">that certain observations of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Kesar Chand v. Uttamchand, 72\\nI. A. 165 at pp. 173, 174 : (A.I.R. (32) 1945 P. C. 91) were too wide and were calculated to effect a\\ndeparture from what had thitherto been known to be the true position in law, he referred these appeals\\nto a Division Bench. These appeals have now come on for hearing before us.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">3a. Up to the time that the decision in Kesar Chand v. Uttam Chand, 72 I. A. 165 : (A.I.R. (32) 1945\\nP.C. 91) was pronounced by their Lordships of the Privy Council the law in regard to the surety\\'s\\ndebts due by the father had been well settled. The position in law has been summarised in Sir Dinshah\\nMulla\\'s Hindu Law, 10th Edn., p. 382, S. 298. It was laid down that:\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"Sons, grandsons and great-grandsons are bound to pay all debts contracted by the father, grandfather\\nor great-grandfather except the following debts : - ....\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">(5) debts for being surety for the appearance or for the honesty of another.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">There is at p. 383 of the book a paragraph in small type under the heading \"Surety\" in which the\\nvarious types of surety debts incurred by the father are discussed. The following passage occurring\\nthere may be noted :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"According  to  Vrihaspati,  there  are  four  different  classes  of  sureties,  namely,  sureties  (1)  for\\nappearance,  (2)  for  honesty,  (3)  for  payment  of  rent;  and  (4)  for  delivery  of  goods.  In  respect  of\\nthe first two kinds, the sons are not liable unless the father received consideration for accepting the\\nsuretyship. In respect of the last two kinds the sons are liable, but the grandsons are not liable unless\\nthe grandfather received consideration for accepting the suretyship. It has thus been held that when\\nthe father is surety for repayment of a loan the son is clearly liable but the grandson is not, unless\\nconsideration was received by the grandfather for accepting the suretyship.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The case with which we are concerned here is the case of the sons, and according to the position as\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">it has been enunciated above, the sons would be liable when the father stood surety for repayment of\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">a loan. It is well known that in the matter of the father having rendered himself personally liable as\\na surety for the repayment of a loan, it would be open to the creditor to sue the father on the surety\\nbond, obtain a decree against him and in execution of that decree attach the joint family properties\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">not only to the extent of the share, right, title and interest of the father therein but also including the\\nshare, right, title and interest of the sons in those properties. This is what was done by defendant 2 in\\nexecution of the decree which he obtained against defendant 4 in Suit No. 223 of 1938 and he was\\ndeclared the auction-purchaser at the sale held on 19-2-1943, of the whole of the suit lands belonging\\nto the joint family inclusive of the share, right, title and interest of the sons therein.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4. The question, however, which arose was whether by reason of the observations of their Lordships\\nof the Privy Council in Kesar Chand V. Uttam Chand, 72 I. A. 165: (A. I. R. (32) 1945 P. C. 91) there\\nwas any difference created in the position as it thitherto obtained in the matter of the sons\\' liability\\nunder the pious obligation, to pay the father\\'s debt where the father had stood surety for the repayment\\nof a loan. The case before their Lordships of the Privy Council was the case of the father Uttam\\nChand having stood surety for the judgment-debtor in an application by the judgment-debtor for stay\\nof execution proceedings. The High Court before whom the appeal against the decree was pending\\nhad ordered that security should be furnished in the form of a charge on immovable property and a\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">security bond was thereupon executed by the father which provided :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"I hereby stand as surety for the minors and agree that in the event of the appellate Court\\'s decision\\nbeing against the judgment-debtors, my movable and immovable properties detailed hereinafter, shall\\nbe liable for making good the deficiency if the amount under the decree was not recovered in full.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The mortgage debt was not paid in time and the decree-holder had the mortgaged property sold in\\nexecution and the decretal debt not being thereby realised in full, four items of ancestral immovable\\nproperty belonging to the guardian the father, only one of which was covered by the surety bond,\\nwere sold in execution. The two sons and the grandsons of the surety who constituted with him a joint\\nHindu family claimed to set aside the sale as not binding on them and for possession of the ancestral\\nproperties so sold. Their Lordships of the Privy Council held on the construction of the surety bond\\nthat the scope of the liability of the surety was limited to proceedings against the properties specified\\nonly, thus creating a charge on them excluding all personal liability. They held that the obligation\\nundertaken by Uttam Chand was merely confined to the extent of the properties charged by him for the\\nsatisfaction of the amount. On this construction of the surety bond, their Lordships-further proceeded\\nto observe that there being no debt due by Uttam Chand but the security bond having been executed\\nby him only for payment of a debt which was due from third parties, there was no question of the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">doctrine of the pious obligation of the sons to pay their father\\'s debt making the transaction binding\\non the ancestral property. They also observed that as it was not shown that Uttam Chand had made\\nhimself personally liable for the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">amount that remained due to the decree-holder there was no debt due from him, and it followed,\\ntherefore, that the unsecured property in question could not be validly sold in enforcement of the\\nsecurity bond. They therefore eschewed the liability in regard to both these properties, secured as well\\nas unsecured ones, by reason of the pious obligation on the sons to pay the father\\'s debt and passed\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the decree accordingly in favour of the sons and the grandson.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">5. Mr. Gumaste for the appellants contended before us that having regard to these observations of their\\nLordships of the Privy Council, we should also hold that there was no debt due by the father but that\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the surety bond was executed by the father for payment of the debt which was due from third parties\\nand that therefore the suit lands which were the joint family properties could not be attached and sold\\nin execution of the decree which had been obtained by defendant 2 against defendant 4 the father.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">6. He was confronted with an unreported decision of our appellate Court consisting of the learned\\nChief Justice and Gajendragadkar J. delivered in Rudragouda Nemangouda v. Gudnaya, S. A. No. 645\\nof 1945, D/- 3-4-1947. There the father of the plaintiffs had stood surety for payment of certain costs\\nand had executed two bonds, one a personal surety bond, and the other a mortgage bond in favour of\\nthe Registrar of the High Court. These bonds had been assigned by the Registrar of the High Court\\nin favour of the respondents and the respondents had sought to enforce the liability against the father.\\nThe plaintiffs, who were the two minor sons of defendant 2 the father, thereupon filed a suit for a\\ndeclaration that their two-thirds share in the ancestral property was not liable for the payment of this\\ndebt of their father. Both the lower Courts dismissed the plaintiffs\\' suit and the plaintiffs then came\\nbefore this Court in second appeal. The learned Judges of the appellate Court reiterated the principles\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of Hindu law which we have referred to above and in regard to the observations of their Lordships\\nof the Privy Council in Kesar Chand v. Uttam Chand, (72 I. A. 165 : A. I. R. (32) 1945 P. C. 91)\\nsaid that the Privy Council had considered the effect of the bond executed by the father and come\\nto the conclusion that on the terms of the bond the father had not undertaken any personal liability\\nand therefore the Privy Council held that as there was no personal liability undertaken by the father,\\nthere was no obligation on the sons and the ancestral property could not be sold in satisfaction of what\\nwas claimed by the mortgagee on that surety bond. It was emphasised that the decision of the Privy\\nCouncil proceeded on the assumption that but for the father not having undertaken a personal liability,\\nthe sons would have been liable on the principle of pious obligation. The only ground why the Privy\\nCouncil came to the conclusion that the sons were not liable was that the father had not undertaken\\na personal liability. These observations of their Lordships of the Privy Council were therefore not\\ntaken by our appeal Court as militating in any manner whatever against the position which had been\\nenunciated thithertofore in regard to the sons\\' liability under the pious obligation to pay the father\\'s\\ndebt due on a surety bond for the repayment of a loan, out of their share, right, title and interest in\\nthe joint family properties.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7. The whole question, in our opinion, turns on the terms of the surety bond. If under the terms of\\nthe surety bond the father has rendered himself personally liable, be it an ordinary personal bond or\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">even a mortgage or a pledge importing personal liability for the deficit if any on the realisation of\\nthe security, the sons are certainly liable to pay the father\\'s personal debt incurred in this manner to\\nthe extent of their right title and interest in the joint family properties. If it is a pure personal bond,\\nthe question can never arise of the nature which has been mooted before us. If it is a mortgage bond\\nor a pledge, as and by way of security, even there the question would have to be considered whether\\nin the event of a deficit arising on the realisation of the mortgage or the pledge by the creditor there\\nwould remain over a personal liability of the father to the extent of the deficit if any. If the surety\\nbond was of the nature which obtained before their Lordships of the Privy Council in Kesar Chand\\nv. Uttam Chand, 72 I. A. 165 : A. I. R. (32) 1945 P. C. 91,there would be no question of the sons\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">being liable for any debt due by the father by reason of their pious obligation, because there would\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">be no personal liability of the father and consequently there would be no debt due by the father as\\nsuch. In such a case there would not arise any question of the sons being liable to pay the father\\'s debt\\nby reason of the pious obligation because there would be no debt due by the father. In those cases,\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">however, where the father has rendered himself personally liable even in the case of a mortgage bond\\nor a hypothecation or pledge of goods to pay the balance over or the deficit, if any, after the realisation\\nof the security, the sons\\' obligation to pay the father\\'s debt by reason of the pious obligation would\\narise and the debt to the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">extent that it has not been satisfied by the realisation of the security would be recoverable by the\\ncreditor from the father as well as the sons out of the joint family properties inclusive of the sons\\'\\nshare, right, title and interest therein.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">8. This being the true position in law, the observations of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Kesar\\nChand v. Uttam Chand, (72 I. A. 165 : A. I. R. (32) 1945 P. C. 91) do not make any departure from\\nthe true position as it had been enunciated before 1945 and the observations of our appeal Court in\\nRudragouda\\'s case, S. A. No. 645 of 1945 D/- 3-4-1947 also are to the same effect. This position in law\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">was enunciated by our appeal Court as early as 1898 in the decision which is reported in Tukarambhat\\nv. Gangaram, 23 Bom. 454, where it was held that the ancestral property in the hands of the sons was\\nliable for the father\\'s debt incurred as a surety. No change has been made in this position which has\\nobtained ever since by the observations of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Kesar Chand v.\\nUttam Chand, (72 I. A. 165 : A. I. R. (32) 1945 P. C. 91) and the position continues to be as it has\\nbeen enunciated here before and has been understood all along at the Bench as well as the bar.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">9. The result, therefore, is that both the appeals will be dismissed. The respondents have not appeared\\nbefore us and therefore there will be no order as to their costs. The appellants will bear and pay their\\nown costs of the appeals.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Appeals Dismissed .\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p></div></div></div></div></div></article>', '<article><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;font-weight:700;margin:10px;margin-bottom:16px\" text=\"1111\">AIR 1951 JAMMU AND KASHMIR 1\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight:600;margin-bottom:20px\">JAMMU AND KASHMIR HIGH COURT\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-weight:600\">CHOWDHARY NIAMAT ULLAH , PRESIDENT and SHIAM\\nKRISHNA DAR , MEMBER and IQBAL AHMED , MEMBER\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Appeal No. 15 of 1949, D/- 17 - 6 - 1950\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Anchal Singh Applt v.

The Public Servants (Inquiries Act) 1977, is an optional\\nmeasure and it is not possible to treat the provisions of that Act as constituting any restrictions upon\\nthe power of dismissal which His Highness or which his Govt. may possess independently of the\\nAct. The Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) framed by His Highness\\' Govt. were not made under\\nthe provisions of any statute and they did not receive the sanction of His Highness on the basis of a\\nlegislative enactment. It is not, therefore, possible to give these Rules a statutory force. Since these\\nRules do not limit in any way the powers of dismissal of the Govt. it is not open to the Ct. to treat\\na wrongful dismissal from service as void and as of no legal effect and to declare that the dismissed\\nservant still continues in service. The claim for arrears of pay or for compensation or damages for\\nwrongful dismissal is equally untenable. Public service carries with it certain implied terms; these are\\nthat it will be at the pleasure of the Crown and it will give no right to pay, pension, compensation or\\ndamages apart from a special contract or a statute on the subject: Case law referred.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">H.N.

At the time when this order of dismissal was made, the applt. was a member\\nof the Civil Service of Kashmir holding the post of the Game Warden.

This order of dismissal was preceded by an enquiry under the Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General)\\nand was followed by an appeal to His Highness, which was dismissed.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4. After taking various other proceedings by way of review and applns. for re-consideration and mercy,\\nthe applt five years after the order of dismissal, instituted a suit out of which this appeal has arisen for\\na declaration that his dismissal was illegal, void and ineffectual and he was still in the service of the\\nState and entitled to his pay and during the pendency of the suit he further claimed by amendment of\\nthe plaint, consequential damages for the wrongful dismissal.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">5. The applt. challenges the order of dismissal on the ground that it was not preceded by an inquiry\\nunder  the  PublicServants  (Inquiries)  Act,  1977,  and  that  the  enquiry  made  against  him  under  the\\nKashmir  Civil  Service  Rules  (General)  was  \"in  the  nature  of  a  farce\"  as  it  did  not  give  him  any\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">sufficient or proper opportunity to clear himself against the charges of which he was found guilty. He\\npleads that Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) have got the force of law and an order of dismissal\\nin contravention of the Act and the Rules is\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">void  and  ineffective.  He  asserts  that  even  if  his  service  was  at  the  pleasure  of  His  Highness,\\nunrestricted by any statute, it was not at the pleasure of His Highness\\' Govt. which could only dismiss\\nhim after following the Rules. And his wrongful dismissal by the Govt. though affirmed in appeal by\\nHis Highness is not tantamount to a dismissal by His Highness in the exercise of his pleasure.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">6. The suit was tried in the original side of the H. G. and at an early stage the following two preliminary\\nquestions about the nature of the service of the applt. and about the binding force of the Kashmir Civil\\nService Rules (General) were referred by Masud Hassan J., for the consideration of the F. B.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"(1) Whether an officer aa contemplated in the Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) is liable to be\\ndismissed from service at the pleasure of the Govt. and has no remedy by way of \\'questioning the\\nlegality of his dismissal in a Civil Ct. and\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">(2) Whether the rules framed under Council Order So. 81 C of 1939, dated 24-9-1939, have any\\nbinding force upon the Govt. or they are only by way of providing guidance to officers authorised\\nto dismiss servant.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7. The answer received from the F. B. to the above two questions was as follows :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"(1) The officer as contemplated in the Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) is not liable to be\\ndismissed from Service at the pleasure of the Govt. and he has remedy by way of questioning the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">legality of his dismissal in a civil Ct.;and\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">(2) The rules framed under Council Order No. 81-C of 1939, dated 24-9-1939, have binding force\\nupon the Govt. and they are not merely by way of providing guidance to officers authorised to dismiss\\nservants.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">These answers are subject to the condition that before an officer has a cause of action in a civil Ct.\\nhe must exhaust, the remedies as prescribed by the Rules and that an order made by His Highness\\ncannot be questioned in a Ct. of Law.\\'\\'\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">8. After the determination of the controversy by the F. B., the case was again heard by Masud Hasan\\nJ., who found that no proper enquiry was made by the Govt. as required by the Kashmir Civil Service\\nRules (General) and that the applt\\'s. dismissal being in contravention of the Rules was wrongful but\\nas  the  applt\\'s  dismissal  had  been  affirmed  in  appeal  by  His  Highness  the  applt.  could  not  seek  a\\ndeclaration of wrongful dismissal from Ct. and his only remedy was to claim damages which claim,\\nhowever, was barred by limitation, and these findings in substance were affirmed in appeal by Wazir\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">C. J. and Kilam J.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">9. The circumstances in which the applt. was dismissed are thus summarised by Masud Hasan J:\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"It is thus clear that throughout all this so-called enquiry the pltf. had no notice as to the action that\\nwas contemplated to be taken against him .... He had not an adequate opportunity of being personally\\nheard in his defence and in the action that was ultimately taken against Mm there were included counts\\nof which he was never charged. This cannot be said to be observing either the spirit or the letter of\\nR. 32 of Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) which it is claimed was complied with in dismissing\\nthe pltf. ..... I am of opinion tint the facts of the present case are much stronger in support of the view\\ntaken and have no hesitation in recording the finding that the dismissal of the pltf. from service was\\nwrongful and illegal,\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">10. These findings of Masud Haaan J. were affirmed in appeal in their entirety by Kilam J. and though\\nthey were challenged before the Board they should be taken as correct and the main controversy before\\nit is confined to the question as to what relief, if any, the applt. is entitled on these findings.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">11. At the outset it is necessary to determine the question whether the service of the applt. was at the\\npleasure of His Highness personally or was it at the pleasure of His Highness\\' Govt. His Highness is\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">undoubtedly the source of all legislative,, executive and Governmental authority in the State. In legal\\ntheory, ha personifies the State and constitutes its Govt. But by Regulation I [1] of 1991, which was\\nin force at the time when the order of dismissal was made, His Highness had constituted a Council\\nwhich, under the General Clauses Act, 1977, constituted his Govt. and to which, under S. 6 of the\\nRegulation, certain powers of His Highness had been delegated.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">12. The fifteenth clause of the third section of the General Clauses Act states: \"Government\" or \\'the\\nGovernment\\' shall mean \\'Council\\' as defined in Regulation 1 [I] of 1991.\" The second section of\\nRegulation 1 [I] of 1991, states \"Council\" means the Council of Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">hereinafter referred to\". The third section of the Regulation states: All powers, legislative, executive\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">and judicial in relation to the State are vested in His Highness. The fourth section of the Regulation\\nprovides that the Govt. of the State shall be conducted in the name of His Highness. The fifth section\\nprovides for the constitution of Council of Ministers and the sixth section states as follows :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"Subject always to the provisions of S. 3 and the exercise in his discretion of the powers and authority\\ninherent as aforesaid in His Highness and subject also to such rules of business and allocation of\\nportfolios and such other directions as to consultation with or reports to and confirmation by His,\\nHighness on specified matters as His Highness may give from time to time by general or special\\norders in that behalf, the superintendence, direction and control of the Civil Administration and Govt.\\nof the State shall be vested in the Council.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">These provisions are followed by the seventh section of the Regulation which provides for certain\\nreserved subjects which are excluded from the jurisdiction of Council or of the Legislative Assembly\\nwhich was brought into existence under the Regulation.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">13. Taken together, these sections mean in substance that subject to the overriding powers of His\\nHighness \"the superintendence, direction and control of Civil Administration and Govt. of the State\"\\nis vested in the Council except in regard to reserved subjects, with the result that the Governmental\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">authority of His Highness, subject to his supervision vests in the Council which becomes His Highness\\'\\nGovt. subject to his supervision for non-reserved subjects.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">14. The power to carry on the Civil Administration and Govt. of the State which was conferred on\\nthe Council by His Highness, necessarily carried\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">with  it  the  power  to  make  appointments,  dismissals  in  the  civil  service  of  the  State.  After  the\\nRegulation came into force, all future appointments, in the civil service of the State should be deemed\\nto be appointments made by the Govt. and under it. And all members of the Civil Service of the State\\nalready employed on the date when the Regulation came into force, should also be deemed to be\\nholding their appointments under the Govt. The applt. was a member of the Civil Service at the time\\nwhen the Regulation i [1] of 1991 came into force and whatever may be the origin of his appointment,\\nby virtue of the Regulation it also came to be under the Govt. by operation of the Regulation.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">15. Before the Regulation I [1] of 1991 came into force, the applt\\'s service was at the pleasure of\\nHis Highness not by reason of any prerogative of His Highness but because the nature of the applt\\'s\\nservice was such that public policy required that it must be at the pleasure of the employer and in\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the case of the applt., of His Highness and this was by reason of the implied terms of his service not\\nby reason of any prerogative of His Highness. This is made clear by Lord Hobhouse in Shenton v.\\nSmith, (1895) A. C. 229 : (64 l.J.P.C.119).\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\\'\\'Unless in special cases where it is otherwise provided servants of the Crown hold their offices during\\nthe pleasure of the Crown; not by virtue of any special prerogative of the Crown, but because such\\nare the terms of their engagement, as is wall understood throughout the publicservice. If any public\\nservant considers that ha has been dismissed unjustly, his remedy is not by a law suit, but by an appeal\\nof an official or political kind.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">16. If the nature of applt\\'s. service before the Regulation (1 [I] of 1991), was such that it had to be at\\nthe pleasure of His Highness by reason of the implied terms of the service, it follows that when the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">applct.\\'s service came under the Govt. after the Regulation, it had to be at the pleasure of the Govt.\\nby reason of the self-same nature of the applt.\\'s service.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">17. Relying upon the distinction which no doubt exists in the laws of the State in regard to the powers\\nof His Highness and the powers of His Highness\\' Govt. the F. B. of the H. C has taken the view that as\\nthe power of dismissal at pleasure, which His Highness possessed, had not been expressly delegated to\\nthe Council, the latter was unable to exercise that pleasure. But this view overlooks the fast the power\\nof the dismissal does not rest upon any prerogative of the Crown which has got to be delegated, on the\\nother hand it rests upon the nature of the service which will remain the same whether it is held under\\nHis Highness or under the Govt. And with all respect to the H. C. the Board, therefore, dissents from\\nthe view that the service of the applt. at the time of his dismissal was not at the pleasure of the Govt.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">18. The service of the applt. being at the pleasure of \\'His Highness or of His Highness\\' Govt., still\\nthe question remains whether his dismissal was void or legally ineffective and he still continues in\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">service or it was only a wrongful dismissal which could only be redressed by the Govt. or by His\\nHighness and for which the applt. has got no remedy in Ct.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">19. It is now settled law that even when the service is at the pleasure of the Crown, either by express\\nterms of the statute or by reason of the implied terms of the service, in either case the exercise of\\nthe pleasure of the Crown may be restricted by express terms of the statute. And any dismissal from\\nservice in contravention of the express terms of the statute applicable to a case will be void and legally\\nineffective and notwithstanding the dismissal the servant would still continue in service and may\\nobtain a declaration from Ct. to that effect; See Gould v. Staurt, (1896) a. C. 575 : (65 l. J. p. c. 82);\\nRangachari v. Secy. of State, a. i. R. (24) 1937 P. C. 27 : (I. L. R. (1937) Mad. 517); The High Commr.\\nof India v. I. M. Lall, A. i. R. (35) 1948 P. C. 121: (75 I. A. 225).\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">20. The applt., therefore, maintains that the exercise of the pleasure of His Highness or of his Govt.\\nwas restricted by the provisions of Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1977. and by R. 32 of the Kashmir\\nCivil Service Rules (General) which have the force of law or statute in the State and the dismissal of\\nthe appellant in contravention of the provisions of these two statutes is void in law and he is entitled\\nto a declaration that he still continues in service on the authority of above cases.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">21. The Public Servants (Inquiries Act) 1977 is an optional measure which gives the Govt. power in\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">certain circumstances to institute a public inquiry under that Act in regard to alleged misbehaviour of\\na public servant. But it is not bound to take any action under that Act if it does not wish or consider\\nit proper to do so. This is made plain by the wording of S. 2 of the Act and it is not possible to treat\\nthe provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act as constituting any restrictions upon the power of\\ndismissal which His Highness or which his Govt. may possess independently of the Act.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">22. The Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) prima facie were framed by His Highness Govt. There\\nis nothing to show that they were made under the provisions of any statute or that they ever received\\nthe sanction of His Highness on the basis of a legislative enactment. It is not, therefore, possible to\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">give these Rules a statutory force. No doubt these rules have been framed by the Govt. with some sort\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of approval by His Highness and they are for the guidance of the Govt. and are binding upon it and\\ncannot be disregarded, but it is one thing to say that the rules are binding upon the Govt. and cannot\\nbe disregarded and it is quite another matter to say that these Rules operate as a condition precedent\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">to the exercise of power of the Govt. or of His Highness to dismiss a servant at pleasure. Such Rules,\\nwhether framed under a statute or independently of it, generally provide for many details and can be\\nchanged at the wish of the Govt. and they have never been treated\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">on the same footing as the provisions of a statute in restricting the power of Grown to dismiss at\\npleasure.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">23. The legal effect of such Rules upon service at pleasure of the Grown has often been the subject\\nof judicial consideration. These Rules contain solemn pledges and assurances given to the services in\\nregard to security and efficiency of the service and they are to be followed in letter and spirit. Any\\nserious violation of the rules renders the dismissal wrongful which it is the responsibility of the Govt.\\nto set right when the matter is brought to their notice by the aggrieved servant. But since these Rules\\ndo not limit in any way the powers of dismissal of the Govt. it is not open to the Ct. to treat such\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">wrongful dismissal as void and as of no legal effect and to declare that the dismissed servant continues\\nin service. See Shenton v. Smith, 1895 A. C. 229: (64 L J. P. C. 119), Venkata Rao v. Secy, of State,\\nA. I. R. (24) 1937 P. C. 31: (I. L. R. (1937) Mad. 532).\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">24. The distinction between a void dismissal and a wrongful dismissal is obvious. In the case of a\\nwrongful dismissal in contravention of statute there is no power of dismissal and it is in a way without\\njurisdiction and consequently void and of no legal effect and the dismissed servant still continues in\\nservice. On the other hand in the case of a wrongful dismissal in contravention of the rules, there is\\nno actual limitation on the power of dismissal which continues unaffected and the dismissal la only\\nirregular which the Ct. is powerless to redress by granting any effective declaration of continuance\\nof service.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">25. The question as to whether the dismissal of the applt. was made by His Highness personally or by\\nhis Govt. is not of any moment if the service of the applt. was in fact at the pleasure of His Highness or\\nhis Govt. It is immaterial who terminated the service or how it was terminated because if the service\\nis at pleasure, no matter how it is terminated. The applt. cannot get a declaration that he still continues\\nin service against the wishes of His Highness or his Govt.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">26. Nor is it possible to accept the contention that in exercising his pleasure in regard to the dismissal\\nof the applt., His Highness was required to follow any particular form or procedure and that the order\\nof the dismissal of the appeal by His Highness in a case of wrongful dismissal by the Council of a\\nservant cannot be taken in fact or in law as an exercise of the pleasure of His Highness. No doubt\\nthere is high authority for the view that a statutory authority which can exercise the power of dismissal\\ncannot delegate this power to any other subordinate, authority : See Rangachari v. Secy, of State, A.\\nI. R. (24) 1937 P. C. 27 : (I. l. R. (1937) Mad. 517). And the dismissal of an appeal by the statutory\\nauthority which has power to dismiss at pleasure is not tantamount to the exercise of pleasure by the\\nstatutory authority itself : See Suraj Narain Anand v. N. W. F. P., A. I. R. (29) 1942 F. C. 3 : (I. L. R.\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">(1941) Kar. P. C. 165). But these principles are not applicable to His Highness who is the repository\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of all judicial, executive and legislative authority and who can lay down such procedure as he likes\\nfor the expression of his pleasure. In deciding appeal against the orders of his Council in cases of\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">wrongful dismissal, His Highness exercises a plenary and complete jurisdiction in exercise of all his\\npowers and his order in these circumstances must be taken to be in the exercise of all his powers.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">27. At the hearing before the Board, the original order in Council by which applt. was dismissed, was\\nproduced and on the face of it, it bore the confirmation of His Highness. The applt. takes exception\\nto its admissibility and to its legal effect. In the view, which the Board had expressed above, it is\\nnot necessary to enter into the question as to whether the Order in Council by which the applt. was\\ndismissed was in fact confirmed by His Highness before the matter reached him in appeal or its effect\\nupon the controversy.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">28. The applt.\\'s claim, therefore, for a declaration of wrongful dismissal and of his still continuance\\nin service cannot be entertained.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">29. The claim for arrears of pay or for compensation or damages for wrongful dismissal is equally\\nuntenable. Public service, like the applt.\\'s carries with it certain implied terms, these are that it will be\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">at the pleasure of the Crown and it will give no right to pay pension, compensation or damages apart\\nfrom a special contract or a statute on the subject. This is well brought out by Lord Thankerton in the\\nCommr. of India v. I. M. Lall, A. I. R. (35) 1948 P. C. 121 : (75 I. A. 225) and in Halsbury Laws of\\nEngland (Hailshan Edn.) vols. VI and IX at p. 608, para. 782 and p. 692, para 1177 respectively.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">30. The H. C. relying upon the Secy, of State v. I. M. Lall, A.I.R. (32) 1945 F. C. 47: (1945 F.C.R.\\n103), had assumed that a claim for damages would lie but found it to be barred by limitation. The\\nauthority relied upon by the H. C. has since been reversed by the P. C. and is no longer available in\\nsupport of that view and the claim for damages must fail both on the ground that it is not maintainable\\nand is also barred by limitation.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">31. This case has some unsatisfactory feature about it. After eighteen years of continuous service in\\nthe Army and in the civil service of the State, the applt. was dismissed without adequate and proper\\ninvestigation into the truth or otherwise of the charges against him. For eleven years now he has\\nbeen seeking redress of this wrong, at first before the Govt. and latterly in the Cts.; where under a\\nmistaken advice and wrong procedure he has paid large sums of money in court-fees. It is not within\\nthe province of this Board to direct after enquiry with strict observance of the rules, the restoration\\nof his service or to retire him on pension or even to refund the unnecessary of. which he has paid but\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">it is open to the Govt. to grant him such\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">redress in these matters as the nature of case may require and it still has an opportunity to do so.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">32. The rights of the parties as they emerge out of the controversy have now been settled. The members\\nof the civil service of the State, and the applt. was one of them, hold their service at the pleasure of the\\nGovt., the Kashmir Civil Service Rules do not possess statutory force and even a substantial disregard\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of their provisions does not furnish a cause of action which can be redressed in Cts. But these rules\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">contain a solemn pledge and assurance for the protection, security and efficiency of the services and\\nit is the responsibility of the Govt. to see that these pledges are strictly honoured in letter and in spirit.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">And the Board trusts that it would be the pleasure of the Govt. to grant necessary redress in all cases\\nwhere a wrong has been done by non-observance of these Rules.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">33.

The Public Servants (Inquiries Act) 1977, is an optional\\nmeasure and it is not possible to treat the provisions of that Act as constituting any restrictions upon\\nthe power of dismissal which His Highness or which his Govt. may possess independently of the\\nAct.

The applt. challenges the order of dismissal on the ground that it was not preceded by an inquiry\\nunder  the  PublicServants  (Inquiries)  Act,  1977,  and  that  the  enquiry  made  against  him  under  the\\nKashmir  Civil  Service  Rules  (General)  was  \"in  the  nature  of  a  farce\"  as  it  did  not  give  him  any\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">sufficient or proper opportunity to clear himself against the charges of which he was found guilty. He\\npleads that Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) have got the force of law and an order of dismissal\\nin contravention of the Act and the Rules is\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">void  and  ineffective.  He  asserts  that  even  if  his  service  was  at  the  pleasure  of  His  Highness,\\nunrestricted by any statute, it was not at the pleasure of His Highness\\' Govt. which could only dismiss\\nhim after following the Rules. And his wrongful dismissal by the Govt. though affirmed in appeal by\\nHis Highness is not tantamount to a dismissal by His Highness in the exercise of his pleasure.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">6. The suit was tried in the original side of the H. G. and at an early stage the following two preliminary\\nquestions about the nature of the service of the applt. and about the binding force of the Kashmir Civil\\nService Rules (General) were referred by Masud Hassan J., for the consideration of the F. B.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"(1) Whether an officer aa contemplated in the Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) is liable to be\\ndismissed from service at the pleasure of the Govt. and has no remedy by way of \\'questioning the\\nlegality of his dismissal in a Civil Ct. and\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">(2) Whether the rules framed under Council Order So. 81 C of 1939, dated 24-9-1939, have any\\nbinding force upon the Govt. or they are only by way of providing guidance to officers authorised\\nto dismiss servant.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7. The answer received from the F. B. to the above two questions was as follows :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"(1) The officer as contemplated in the Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) is not liable to be\\ndismissed from Service at the pleasure of the Govt. and he has remedy by way of questioning the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">legality of his dismissal in a civil Ct.;and\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">(2) The rules framed under Council Order No. 81-C of 1939, dated 24-9-1939, have binding force\\nupon the Govt. and they are not merely by way of providing guidance to officers authorised to dismiss\\nservants.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">These answers are subject to the condition that before an officer has a cause of action in a civil Ct.\\nhe must exhaust, the remedies as prescribed by the Rules and that an order made by His Highness\\ncannot be questioned in a Ct. of Law.\\'\\'\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">8. After the determination of the controversy by the F. B., the case was again heard by Masud Hasan\\nJ., who found that no proper enquiry was made by the Govt. as required by the Kashmir Civil Service\\nRules (General) and that the applt\\'s. dismissal being in contravention of the Rules was wrongful but\\nas  the  applt\\'s  dismissal  had  been  affirmed  in  appeal  by  His  Highness  the  applt.  could  not  seek  a\\ndeclaration of wrongful dismissal from Ct. and his only remedy was to claim damages which claim,\\nhowever, was barred by limitation, and these findings in substance were affirmed in appeal by Wazir\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">C. J. and Kilam J.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">9. The circumstances in which the applt. was dismissed are thus summarised by Masud Hasan J:\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"It is thus clear that throughout all this so-called enquiry the pltf. had no notice as to the action that\\nwas contemplated to be taken against him .... He had not an adequate opportunity of being personally\\nheard in his defence and in the action that was ultimately taken against Mm there were included counts\\nof which he was never charged. This cannot be said to be observing either the spirit or the letter of\\nR. 32 of Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) which it is claimed was complied with in dismissing\\nthe pltf. ..... I am of opinion tint the facts of the present case are much stronger in support of the view\\ntaken and have no hesitation in recording the finding that the dismissal of the pltf. from service was\\nwrongful and illegal,\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">10. These findings of Masud Haaan J. were affirmed in appeal in their entirety by Kilam J. and though\\nthey were challenged before the Board they should be taken as correct and the main controversy before\\nit is confined to the question as to what relief, if any, the applt. is entitled on these findings.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">11. At the outset it is necessary to determine the question whether the service of the applt. was at the\\npleasure of His Highness personally or was it at the pleasure of His Highness\\' Govt. His Highness is\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">undoubtedly the source of all legislative,, executive and Governmental authority in the State. In legal\\ntheory, ha personifies the State and constitutes its Govt. But by Regulation I [1] of 1991, which was\\nin force at the time when the order of dismissal was made, His Highness had constituted a Council\\nwhich, under the General Clauses Act, 1977, constituted his Govt. and to which, under S. 6 of the\\nRegulation, certain powers of His Highness had been delegated.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">12. The fifteenth clause of the third section of the General Clauses Act states: \"Government\" or \\'the\\nGovernment\\' shall mean \\'Council\\' as defined in Regulation 1 [I] of 1991.\" The second section of\\nRegulation 1 [I] of 1991, states \"Council\" means the Council of Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">hereinafter referred to\". The third section of the Regulation states: All powers, legislative, executive\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">and judicial in relation to the State are vested in His Highness. The fourth section of the Regulation\\nprovides that the Govt. of the State shall be conducted in the name of His Highness. The fifth section\\nprovides for the constitution of Council of Ministers and the sixth section states as follows :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"Subject always to the provisions of S. 3 and the exercise in his discretion of the powers and authority\\ninherent as aforesaid in His Highness and subject also to such rules of business and allocation of\\nportfolios and such other directions as to consultation with or reports to and confirmation by His,\\nHighness on specified matters as His Highness may give from time to time by general or special\\norders in that behalf, the superintendence, direction and control of the Civil Administration and Govt.\\nof the State shall be vested in the Council.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">These provisions are followed by the seventh section of the Regulation which provides for certain\\nreserved subjects which are excluded from the jurisdiction of Council or of the Legislative Assembly\\nwhich was brought into existence under the Regulation.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">13. Taken together, these sections mean in substance that subject to the overriding powers of His\\nHighness \"the superintendence, direction and control of Civil Administration and Govt. of the State\"\\nis vested in the Council except in regard to reserved subjects, with the result that the Governmental\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">authority of His Highness, subject to his supervision vests in the Council which becomes His Highness\\'\\nGovt. subject to his supervision for non-reserved subjects.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">14. The power to carry on the Civil Administration and Govt. of the State which was conferred on\\nthe Council by His Highness, necessarily carried\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">with  it  the  power  to  make  appointments,  dismissals  in  the  civil  service  of  the  State.  After  the\\nRegulation came into force, all future appointments, in the civil service of the State should be deemed\\nto be appointments made by the Govt. and under it. And all members of the Civil Service of the State\\nalready employed on the date when the Regulation came into force, should also be deemed to be\\nholding their appointments under the Govt. The applt. was a member of the Civil Service at the time\\nwhen the Regulation i [1] of 1991 came into force and whatever may be the origin of his appointment,\\nby virtue of the Regulation it also came to be under the Govt. by operation of the Regulation.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">15. Before the Regulation I [1] of 1991 came into force, the applt\\'s service was at the pleasure of\\nHis Highness not by reason of any prerogative of His Highness but because the nature of the applt\\'s\\nservice was such that public policy required that it must be at the pleasure of the employer and in\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the case of the applt., of His Highness and this was by reason of the implied terms of his service not\\nby reason of any prerogative of His Highness. This is made clear by Lord Hobhouse in Shenton v.\\nSmith, (1895) A. C. 229 : (64 l.J.P.C.119).\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\\'\\'Unless in special cases where it is otherwise provided servants of the Crown hold their offices during\\nthe pleasure of the Crown; not by virtue of any special prerogative of the Crown, but because such\\nare the terms of their engagement, as is wall understood throughout the publicservice. If any public\\nservant considers that ha has been dismissed unjustly, his remedy is not by a law suit, but by an appeal\\nof an official or political kind.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">16. If the nature of applt\\'s. service before the Regulation (1 [I] of 1991), was such that it had to be at\\nthe pleasure of His Highness by reason of the implied terms of the service, it follows that when the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">applct.\\'s service came under the Govt. after the Regulation, it had to be at the pleasure of the Govt.\\nby reason of the self-same nature of the applt.\\'s service.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">17. Relying upon the distinction which no doubt exists in the laws of the State in regard to the powers\\nof His Highness and the powers of His Highness\\' Govt. the F. B. of the H. C has taken the view that as\\nthe power of dismissal at pleasure, which His Highness possessed, had not been expressly delegated to\\nthe Council, the latter was unable to exercise that pleasure. But this view overlooks the fast the power\\nof the dismissal does not rest upon any prerogative of the Crown which has got to be delegated, on the\\nother hand it rests upon the nature of the service which will remain the same whether it is held under\\nHis Highness or under the Govt. And with all respect to the H. C. the Board, therefore, dissents from\\nthe view that the service of the applt. at the time of his dismissal was not at the pleasure of the Govt.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">18. The service of the applt. being at the pleasure of \\'His Highness or of His Highness\\' Govt., still\\nthe question remains whether his dismissal was void or legally ineffective and he still continues in\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">service or it was only a wrongful dismissal which could only be redressed by the Govt. or by His\\nHighness and for which the applt. has got no remedy in Ct.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">19. It is now settled law that even when the service is at the pleasure of the Crown, either by express\\nterms of the statute or by reason of the implied terms of the service, in either case the exercise of\\nthe pleasure of the Crown may be restricted by express terms of the statute. And any dismissal from\\nservice in contravention of the express terms of the statute applicable to a case will be void and legally\\nineffective and notwithstanding the dismissal the servant would still continue in service and may\\nobtain a declaration from Ct. to that effect; See Gould v. Staurt, (1896) a. C. 575 : (65 l. J. p. c. 82);\\nRangachari v. Secy. of State, a. i. R. (24) 1937 P. C. 27 : (I. L. R. (1937) Mad. 517); The High Commr.\\nof India v. I. M. Lall, A. i. R. (35) 1948 P. C. 121: (75 I. A. 225).\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">20. The applt., therefore, maintains that the exercise of the pleasure of His Highness or of his Govt.\\nwas restricted by the provisions of Public Servants (Inquiries) Act, 1977. and by R. 32 of the Kashmir\\nCivil Service Rules (General) which have the force of law or statute in the State and the dismissal of\\nthe appellant in contravention of the provisions of these two statutes is void in law and he is entitled\\nto a declaration that he still continues in service on the authority of above cases.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">21. The Public Servants (Inquiries Act) 1977 is an optional measure which gives the Govt. power in\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">certain circumstances to institute a public inquiry under that Act in regard to alleged misbehaviour of\\na public servant. But it is not bound to take any action under that Act if it does not wish or consider\\nit proper to do so. This is made plain by the wording of S. 2 of the Act and it is not possible to treat\\nthe provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act as constituting any restrictions upon the power of\\ndismissal which His Highness or which his Govt. may possess independently of the Act.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">22. The Kashmir Civil Service Rules (General) prima facie were framed by His Highness Govt. There\\nis nothing to show that they were made under the provisions of any statute or that they ever received\\nthe sanction of His Highness on the basis of a legislative enactment. It is not, therefore, possible to\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">give these Rules a statutory force. No doubt these rules have been framed by the Govt. with some sort\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of approval by His Highness and they are for the guidance of the Govt. and are binding upon it and\\ncannot be disregarded, but it is one thing to say that the rules are binding upon the Govt. and cannot\\nbe disregarded and it is quite another matter to say that these Rules operate as a condition precedent\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">to the exercise of power of the Govt. or of His Highness to dismiss a servant at pleasure. Such Rules,\\nwhether framed under a statute or independently of it, generally provide for many details and can be\\nchanged at the wish of the Govt. and they have never been treated\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">on the same footing as the provisions of a statute in restricting the power of Grown to dismiss at\\npleasure.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">23. The legal effect of such Rules upon service at pleasure of the Grown has often been the subject\\nof judicial consideration. These Rules contain solemn pledges and assurances given to the services in\\nregard to security and efficiency of the service and they are to be followed in letter and spirit. Any\\nserious violation of the rules renders the dismissal wrongful which it is the responsibility of the Govt.\\nto set right when the matter is brought to their notice by the aggrieved servant. But since these Rules\\ndo not limit in any way the powers of dismissal of the Govt. it is not open to the Ct. to treat such\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">wrongful dismissal as void and as of no legal effect and to declare that the dismissed servant continues\\nin service. See Shenton v. Smith, 1895 A. C. 229: (64 L J. P. C. 119), Venkata Rao v. Secy, of State,\\nA. I. R. (24) 1937 P. C. 31: (I. L. R. (1937) Mad. 532).\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">24. The distinction between a void dismissal and a wrongful dismissal is obvious. In the case of a\\nwrongful dismissal in contravention of statute there is no power of dismissal and it is in a way without\\njurisdiction and consequently void and of no legal effect and the dismissed servant still continues in\\nservice. On the other hand in the case of a wrongful dismissal in contravention of the rules, there is\\nno actual limitation on the power of dismissal which continues unaffected and the dismissal la only\\nirregular which the Ct. is powerless to redress by granting any effective declaration of continuance\\nof service.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">25. The question as to whether the dismissal of the applt. was made by His Highness personally or by\\nhis Govt. is not of any moment if the service of the applt. was in fact at the pleasure of His Highness or\\nhis Govt. It is immaterial who terminated the service or how it was terminated because if the service\\nis at pleasure, no matter how it is terminated. The applt. cannot get a declaration that he still continues\\nin service against the wishes of His Highness or his Govt.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">26. Nor is it possible to accept the contention that in exercising his pleasure in regard to the dismissal\\nof the applt., His Highness was required to follow any particular form or procedure and that the order\\nof the dismissal of the appeal by His Highness in a case of wrongful dismissal by the Council of a\\nservant cannot be taken in fact or in law as an exercise of the pleasure of His Highness. No doubt\\nthere is high authority for the view that a statutory authority which can exercise the power of dismissal\\ncannot delegate this power to any other subordinate, authority : See Rangachari v. Secy, of State, A.\\nI. R. (24) 1937 P. C. 27 : (I. l. R. (1937) Mad. 517). And the dismissal of an appeal by the statutory\\nauthority which has power to dismiss at pleasure is not tantamount to the exercise of pleasure by the\\nstatutory authority itself : See Suraj Narain Anand v. N. W. F. P., A. I. R. (29) 1942 F. C. 3 : (I. L. R.\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">(1941) Kar. P. C. 165). But these principles are not applicable to His Highness who is the repository\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of all judicial, executive and legislative authority and who can lay down such procedure as he likes\\nfor the expression of his pleasure. In deciding appeal against the orders of his Council in cases of\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">wrongful dismissal, His Highness exercises a plenary and complete jurisdiction in exercise of all his\\npowers and his order in these circumstances must be taken to be in the exercise of all his powers.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">27. At the hearing before the Board, the original order in Council by which applt. was dismissed, was\\nproduced and on the face of it, it bore the confirmation of His Highness. The applt. takes exception\\nto its admissibility and to its legal effect. In the view, which the Board had expressed above, it is\\nnot necessary to enter into the question as to whether the Order in Council by which the applt. was\\ndismissed was in fact confirmed by His Highness before the matter reached him in appeal or its effect\\nupon the controversy.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">28. The applt.\\'s claim, therefore, for a declaration of wrongful dismissal and of his still continuance\\nin service cannot be entertained.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">29. The claim for arrears of pay or for compensation or damages for wrongful dismissal is equally\\nuntenable. Public service, like the applt.\\'s carries with it certain implied terms, these are that it will be\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">at the pleasure of the Crown and it will give no right to pay pension, compensation or damages apart\\nfrom a special contract or a statute on the subject. This is well brought out by Lord Thankerton in the\\nCommr. of India v. I. M. Lall, A. I. R. (35) 1948 P. C. 121 : (75 I. A. 225) and in Halsbury Laws of\\nEngland (Hailshan Edn.) vols. VI and IX at p. 608, para. 782 and p. 692, para 1177 respectively.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">30. The H. C. relying upon the Secy, of State v. I. M. Lall, A.I.R. (32) 1945 F. C. 47: (1945 F.C.R.\\n103), had assumed that a claim for damages would lie but found it to be barred by limitation. The\\nauthority relied upon by the H. C. has since been reversed by the P. C. and is no longer available in\\nsupport of that view and the claim for damages must fail both on the ground that it is not maintainable\\nand is also barred by limitation.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">31. This case has some unsatisfactory feature about it. After eighteen years of continuous service in\\nthe Army and in the civil service of the State, the applt. was dismissed without adequate and proper\\ninvestigation into the truth or otherwise of the charges against him. For eleven years now he has\\nbeen seeking redress of this wrong, at first before the Govt. and latterly in the Cts.; where under a\\nmistaken advice and wrong procedure he has paid large sums of money in court-fees. It is not within\\nthe province of this Board to direct after enquiry with strict observance of the rules, the restoration\\nof his service or to retire him on pension or even to refund the unnecessary of. which he has paid but\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">it is open to the Govt. to grant him such\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">redress in these matters as the nature of case may require and it still has an opportunity to do so.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">32.

Ram Labhaya, J. -The facts leading to this appeal by contesting defendants 1-3 are as follows :\\nDag No.695 corresponding to the present dag No 508 was part of the lakheraj lands owned by Hajo\\nMadhab Temple. Defendant 19 is the present Daloi of the temple. The present area of the dag in\\nquestion is 5 B 3 K 16 Lessas.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">2. This land was held by Paiks of the temple on condition of rendering services to the deity. In 1889 a\\ndispute arose between two groups of tenants. The predecessor-in-interest of the plaintiff of the present\\nsuit, belonged to the group which was found entitled to tenancy rights in 9/20th share of the dag in\\nquestion. The ancestors of the defendants (1-18, both contesting and pro forma) were found entitled\\nto tenancy rights in the rest, viz., 11/20th share.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">3. One Lakshminarayan got a money decree against some tenants of the group of the plain. tiff and\\ngot to entire dag attached in execution of his decree. Objections were raised to the attachment and, it\\nappears, an Amin was appointed to make local enquiries as to the claims of the objectors. An attested\\ncopy of the report has been placed on the record. It appears from the report that there were three groups\\nof objectors. The present plaintiff with others claimed 3 K 4 L. The Amin found them in possession\\nof the area they claimed.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">This portion was marked Ka. Another group of objectors was found to be in possession of 2 B 3 K\\n7 L. This portion was marked Kha. The rest of the area of the dag 2 B 2 K 5 L marked Ga was not\\nin the actual possession of anyone. It was described\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">as dense forest. Exhibit 4 is an attested copy of the order on the claim put forward by the present\\nplaintiff with others. This claim was disallowed on a compromise. No reference was made to the\\nAmin\\'s report in the order. No other order in the objection proceedings has been placed on the record.\\nThe attested copy of the sale certificate on the record shows that 9/20th share from the dag was put\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">to auction and sold. The sale was not of any specified portion or plot. The cosharers may have held\\nspecified portions of land in groups and different cosharers in the two groups may also have occupied\\nseparate plots. But what was put to sale was not the specified plot or plots in the possession of the\\njudgment-debtors but the undivided share to which they were entitled as tenants. The decree-holder\\naccording to the certificate became the purchaser of the tenancy rights in the dag in question to the\\nextent of the share mentioned in the sale certificate, i. e., 9/20th share. It is claimed by the plaintiff\\nthat the decree-holder auction-purchaser purchased and got possession of specified portions Ka and\\nGa measuring 3 B 0 K 9 L, though he remained in actual possession of the Ka portion measuring 3\\nK 4 L on behalf of the decree-holder.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4. On 24th September 1935 Surjyanarayan, brother of Lakshminarayan who had died, sold to him 2 B\\n2 K 19 L out of the land said to have been purchased by his brother Lakshminarayan marked Ka and\\nGa in Amin\\'s report. In the sale deed Surjyanarayan, the vendor, claimed that they (meaning he and\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">his brother) had purchased the area (2B 2K 19L) on 21st June 1921 in a court sale out of dag No 695\\nmeasuring 5B 3K 16L and they obtained possession through Court of the two specified plots Ka and\\nGa This he purported to sell to the present plaintiff who alleges that he was in actual possession even\\nbefore sale though on behalf of the auction-purchaser. On the basis of the sale deed, the plaintiff got\\na chitha mutation in his favour on 23rd march 1936. His case now is that he purchased two specified\\nplots of the dag n question from the auction purchasers who were the owner of tenancy rights. He\\nwas also in possession till 1937 when a portion of the area in his possession was encroached upon by\\ndefendants 1.3. A complaint was lodged against them but they were acquitted on 12th march 1937.\\nOn 14th May 1939 plaintiff applied for demarcation of boundaries which were settled by order dated\\n7th June 1939. Plaintiff further alleged that he removed his dwelling houses from the portion marked\\nKa to another plot at a distance of about a quarter of a mile. Defendants taking advantage of this fact\\ntook forcible possession of the entire area of 3K 4L (Ka portion). On the basis of their possession\\nthey also got a mutation in their names during the last Temple Survey Operations. Plaintiff, therefore.\\ninstituted the suit which gives rise to this appeal for a declaration of his right and title to the plot\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">measuring 3K 4L (Ka portion) and also for recovery of its khas possession.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">5. The claim was resisted by defendants 1-3. Pro forma defendants 4-9, 11 and 12, 13-16 and 18\\nsupported the plaintiff\\'s claim by a joint written statement. Defendants 10, 17 and 19 were proceeded\\nagainst ex parte. The trial Court dismissed the suit holding that the suit was not maintainable in the\\nform in which it was laid. The Court also found that the suit was barred by time and plaintiff\\'s title\\nto the land if any, had been extinguished by adverse possession on the part of the defendants. It was\\nfurther found that plaintiff had no right, title and interest in the suit land nor was he in possession\\nthereof and dispossessed as alleged by him.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">6. On appeal by the plaintiff, the learned Second Additional Judge, A.V.D. reversed the decree of the\\nlearned Munsif and decreed the claim. He granted plaintiff a declaration of title to the suit land and\\nfurther ordered that he be put in khas possession thereof.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7. On behalf of defendant-appellants Mr. Ghose has assailed the correctness of the appellate order on\\nthree grounds. He has contended, first, that the tenancy was inalienable. The sale in execution of decree\\nby which the auction purchaser became the owner of tenancy rights to the extent of 9/20th share was\\nvoid and similarly the subsequent transfer of 1935 on which the plaintiff based his title. The second\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">ground of attack was that Surjyanarayan who purported to convey the rights which Lakshminarayan\\nhad acquired under the court sale was not competent to transfer those rights and the transfer, therefore\\ndid not pass any valid title to the plaintiff. His last contention was that in no case could the plaintiff\\nbe granted a decree declaring his exclusive title to a specified plot ; nor could a decree for its khas\\npossession be granted to him. We shall deal with these contentions seriatim.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7a. . So far as the first contention is concerned, it is argued that the land belongs to the temple. Plaintiff\\nand defendants were tenants under the temple as paiks. They held the land on condition of rendering\\nservices to the deity. Their tenure was subject to services which they had to render As the obligation\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">to render services could not be transferred to non-paiks, the land also became inalienable. The land\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">cannot be disassociated from the obligations that it carried. The contention in short is that the tenancy\\nin question is of a peculiar kind and\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">8. This authority is of no avail to the learned counsel. It does not hold that a transfer of the paikan\\nland is void. Such a transfer violates no statutory direction. It may not be valid and binding on the\\ntemple for reasons given by their Lordships in that judgment. But it cannot be said that a transfer\\nof the tenancy would be absolutely void. The temple authorities may consent to or acquiesce in the\\ntransfer. They may accept services from a non-paik transferee or if he is not capable of rendering\\nservices they may accept rent in cash from him. There is nothing to prevent the temple authorities from\\nadopting these courses. A transfer without their consent and acquiescence which seeks to sopsrate the\\nobligations of the land from its enjoyment would certainly be voidable at the instance of the temple\\nauthorities. The authority relied on by the learned counsel does not sup. port his argument that the\\nalienation in such circumstances would be wholly void. In fact the question whether an alienation\\nof the rights of paik was void or not was not before their Lordships of the Calcutta High Court. So\\nfar as this case is concerned, even if it is assumed for purposes of argument that the auction sale\\ncontravened the custom relating to transfers of Paikan land and was therefore void, it will not affect\\nthe claim of the plaintiff. The sale was made under the orders of the Court in execution proceedings.\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">It was preceded by attachment. There were objections to the attachment from the tenants. The temple\\nauthorities could not have been unaware of the sale. They did not raise any objection. The sale was\\nmade and confirmed. The auction purchaser was shown in the revenue records as a cosharer tenant.\\nThe auction sale came in 1920. The purchaser was obviously recognised as a tenant by the temple\\nauthorities. The Daloi of the temple, who is a defendant in the case, does not challenge either the\\nauction sale or the subsequent transfer in plaintiff\\'s favour. The auction sale of the tenancy rights has\\nnot been challenged within the period allowed by law. Therefore, even if the transfer was originally\\nvoid, the title of Lakshminarayan, the auction-purchaser, could not now be disputed by the temple\\nauthorities by reason of the efflux of time. In these circumstances contesting defendants can have no\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">right to challenge the transaction. They did not raise this question in the Court below and it has not\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">been raised even in their grounds of appeal. The second sale in favour of the plaintiff was in favour of\\na Paik and it has not been contended by anyone of the defendants including the Daloi, the manager of\\nthe temple, that the sale was objectionable on the ground that the obligations as to service had been\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">divorced from the rights and privileges which the occupation of the land carried. This contention,\\nthere. fore, has got no force. It finds no support from authority.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">9. The second contention need not detain us long. The objection is that Surjyamarayan who transferred\\nthe rights in the disputed land to the plaintiff was not competent to do so as Lakshminarayan alone\\nwas the auction-purchaser. Surjyanarayan has appeared as a witness in the case. He has explained\\nthat he and Lakshminarayan the deceased were brothers. They were both members of a joint Hindu\\nfamily and after the death of Lakshminarayan he became the karta of the family. His nephew, a son of\\nLakshminarayan, was also a member of the family. He, therefore, was competent to make the transfer\\nand it was made with the consent and acquiescence of Lakshminarayan\\'s son who signed the deed\\nof sale as an attesting witness. In fact, while attesting the deed at the time of execution, he gave his\\nconsent to the transfer in express terms. Before registration the words conveying his express consent\\nwere scored through. The explanation given for this is that they were advised that consent to the\\ntransfer in express terms would render the document liable to fresh\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">stamp  duty  and  will  give  rise  to  other  complications.  The  attestation  as  a  witness,  therefore,  was\\nallowed to remain and the rest of the endorsement was crossed and was for all practical purposes\\ndeleted. This statement of Surjyanaraan has not been rebutted by any evidence. Lakshminarayan\\'s\\nson,  who  was  evidently  aware  of  the  transfer,  has  not  objected  to  it.  He  has  not  been  examined\\nby the defendants. He is the only person who could object to the transfer. Even though setting up\\nhis title, the defendants have not examined him. The inference is irresistible that Lakshminarayan\\'s\\nson does not question the competency of his uncle to transfer the tenancy right to the plaintiff. In\\nthese circumstances the sale in plaintiff\\'s favour could be enforced against the present defendants.\\nLakshminarayan\\'s  son  is  not  a  party.  He  would  not  be  bound  by  this  decision  but  so  far  as  the\\ndefendants are concerned, they cannot by their denial alone prevent the plaintiff from claiming relief\\non the basis of the sale-deed in his favour, which apparently has been consented to by one who is the\\ntrue owner according to defendants. The contention is repelled.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">10. The last contention raised by the learned counsel is that there was no justification for the appellate\\nCourt to grant a declaration of title to and khas possession of the specified plot of land which is\\none of the two plots which the sale-deed purports to transfer to the plaintiff. The learned counsel is\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">on surer ground here. Under the sale certificate and according to the entries in the revenue records\\nLakshminarayan, the auction purchaser, was a cosharer tenant. He had purchased tenancy rights to\\nthe extent of 9/20th share. There is no allegation or proof that there was any binding partition between\\nthe co-sharers after the auction sale. It is possible that co-sharers may have been holding specified\\nplots in their separate possession under an amicable arrangement for purposes of convenience. But\\nby  that  arrangement  they  would  not  become  exclusive  owners  of  the  plots  in  their  possession.\\nLakshminarayan therefore could not be the exclusive owner of any specified plot even if he was in\\npossession of it as under the sale certificate he purchased an undivided share in the tenancy and not\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">specified plots. Lakshminarayan\\'s successors in interest could not sell anything more than he had\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">purchased. They could only transfer to the plaintiff the undivided share in the tenancy of which they\\nwere owners. They could also transfer to him the possession of any plot that they have as co-sharers.\\nBut they could not convey exclusive title to any specified plot. The sale-deed in plaintiff\\'s favour\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">conveys to him two plots described as Ka and Ga within definite boundaries. The plaintiff\\'s claim\\nis that even though the auction certificate does not mention these specified plots, Lakshminarayan\\nwas the purchaser of these plots and was in possession through him and by virtue of the sale-deed of\\n1935, he acquired exclusive title to these plots. Defendants dispossessed him from one specified plot\\nmarked Ka. On the basis of exclusive title and exclusive possession he claims a declaration of title\\nand khas possession. As indicated above there is no basis for a finding that he is exclusively entitled\\nto the plot in suit. The learned Judge in appeal appears to have been influenced by the Amin\\'s report in\\ncoming to the finding that what was sold at the auction was not an undivided share but two specified\\nplots. We do not find any justification for this view. The oral evidence in the case is not conclusive.\\nIf specified plots were sold, there is no reason why the sale certificate should not have evidenced\\nthe sale of the specified plots. The records of the execution proceedings in which the property was\\nsold are not available. They are said to have been destroyed. The Amin\\'s report which appears to\\nhave influenced the learned Judge is not helpful. It does not indicate what exactly was put up for\\nauction. Besides it has been objected to as inadmissible though it is not necessary to decide this point\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">as even if admitted it does not support the claim that specified plots were put up for sale. There is no\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">documentary evidence on this point except the certificate which shows that what was purchased was\\nan undivided share. In the absence of any proof of a binding partition before the auction sale, it seems\\nmore probable that tenancy rights in specified plots were not sold. We are, therefore, of the opinion\\nthat the learned Subordinate Judge had no legal basis or justification for holding in defiance of the\\ncontents of the sale certificate that two specified plots were sold. In these circumstances, a decree\\ndeclaring the title of the plaintiff to the specified plot in suit was not at all possible in law and yet this\\nis what the plaintiff has claimed. He might have claimed in the alternative that he was at least entitled\\nto 9/20th share in the tenancy. No such claim has been put forwarded. The suit is only for a specified\\nplot measuring 3 K. 4 L. out of the entire dag. A decree that he is entitled to a larger area than that\\nclaimed by him as a co-sharer cannot be passed, as the entire dag is not in suit and 9/20th share of\\nthe whole is not being claimed. The declaratory relief granted to the plaintiff by the lower appellate\\nCourt is, therefore, contrary to law and the decree to this extent cannot stand.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">11. As regards khas possession of a specified plot, the position is no less difficult. A co-sharer\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">may ask to be restored to possession of a specified plot, if his case is that he was occupying a specified\\nplot as a co-sharer under an amicable arrangement between the co-sharers and was dispossessed by\\nanother co-sharer. But that is not the case here. Even if it is assumed for purposes of argument that the\\nparticular plot in suit was in plaintiff\\'s possession before the sale in his favour on behalf of the auction-\\npurchaser and was subsequently in his possession as a co-sharer in the tenancy, it is not possible to\\ngrant him relief in this case as he is not suing as a co-sharer whose possession has been disturbed in\\nthat capacity. His suit is for exclusive title and for exclusive possession. He has not been able to prove\\nexclusive title and therefore he is not entitled to exclusive possession also. There is thus no basis for\\ngranting him exclusive or khas possession of the property. If he had taken up the position that he was\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">entitled to a specified plot as a co-sharer, as his possession as a co-sharer had been disturbed, the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">claim could certainly have been considered.

Order.-This rule was issued upon the Deputy Commissioner, Nowgong, to show cause why the\\nconvictions and sentences imposed on the petitioner should not be set aside. The case for the Crown\\nwas that the petitioner was travelling on the train from Pandu through Gauhati on 14th October 1947.\\nHis conduct aroused suspicion and he and his luggage were searched. In the trunks belonging to him\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">was found 37 seers of opium. Evidence was adduced by the prosecution in support of these allegations\\nand the learned Magistrate, believing the evidence, found the petitioner guilty u/S.9 (a) of Act I [1]\\nof 1878 and sentenced him under that section to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years, and to\\npay a fine of 113, 1,000 in default, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further period of one year.\\nThe learned Magistrate also found the petitioner guilty u/S.9 (c) of the said Act on the same facts, and\\nsentenced him under that section to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine\\nof Rs. 1,000 and in default of payment of fine, to suffer rigorous imprisonment for a further period of\\none year. The learned Magistrate further directed that the sentences should run consecutively.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">2. The petitioner appealed. The learned Sessions Judge, after hearing the learned advocate for the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">appellant, called for the record of the case, but did not say that the appeal would be heard, and did not\\npass any orders admitting the appeal. After perusing the record, the learned Sessions Judge directed\\nthat the appeal be die. missed summarily. It is against that order that the present rule has been obtained.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">3. Mr. Sen for the petitioner has pointed out that separate convictions u/S.9 (a) and S.9 (c) of the said\\nAct for the same offence were not justified.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4. If the petitioner imported the opium, he did so by carrying it himself, and his possession was the\\nmethod of importing it. In our opinion, the learned Magistrate was not justified in convicting him\\nfor two separate offences for the same act, and in imposing two separate sentences therefore, In fact,\\non the evidence, it is impossible to say that there was any evidence of an offence of importing. The\\nevidence against the accused was merely that he was in possession of the opium and that he had a\\nticket from Pandu a station in Assam. The evidence proved possession of opium, but did not prove\\nimportation of opium. Mr. San contended further\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">that the learned Sessions Judge, in view of the nature of the evidence, ought to have heard the appeal\\nproperly and to have delivered a judgment after hearing the appeal.

We are unable to hold that the evidence was of such a nature that the learned Judge ought to have\\nheard the appeal in full. We, therefore, order that the rule be made absolute to this extent only, viz:\\nconviction and sentence u/S.9 (a), is upheld but the conviction and sentence u/S.9 (c) of the Act is set\\naside and the appellant is acquitted of the charge of importation.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Order Accordingly .\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p></div></div></article>', '<article><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:18px;font-weight:700;margin:10px;margin-bottom:16px\" text=\"1111\">AIR 1950 ASSAM 6\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\"><span style=\"font-size:14px;font-weight:600;margin-bottom:20px\">ASSAM HIGH COURT\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px;font-weight:600\">THADANI , Actg.

The petition was\\npresented to Sir R. F. Lodge, the then Chief Justice of this Court on 1st June 1948. He was the only\\nJudge of the Court at that time. No other Judge had been appointed till then He heard the advocate for\\nthe petitioner and directed that a rule should issue calling upon the Court concerned to show cause\\nwhy the order complained of in the petition be not set aside. Usual notices on the opposite parties\\nwere also ordered to issue. Further proceedings in the suit were stayed.

The learned counsel for the opposite parties (plaintiffs) has raised two preliminary objections, both\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of a somewhat unusual character. The first objection is that on 1st June when the petition of revision\\nwas presented and received, this High Court was not properly\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">constituted and the Chief Justice, therefore, had no jurisdiction either to receive\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the petition or to issue a rule on it.The objection is based on the language of S.3,\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Assam High Court Order, 1948. This section provides that:\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"As from 5th April 1948, (hereinafter referred to as the prescribed day\\'), there shall be a High Court for\\nthe Province of Assam which shall be a Court of record, and shall consist of a Chief Justice and such\\nother Judges as the Governor General may from time to time, whether before or after the prescribed\\nday, appoint in accordance with the provisions of S. 220 of the Act.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">It is urged that the High Court, according to this section, must consist of a Chief Justice and such\\nother Judges as the Governor-General may from time to time appoint. The Chief Justice alone could\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">not constitute the High Court. The appointment of some other Judges was essential. The direction, it\\nis argued, is mandatory and the High Court could not come into existence till in conformity with the\\ndirection the Governor-General had appointed other Judges necessary to constitute the High Court.\\nOur attention has already been drawn to the provisions contained in S. 220, Government of India Act,\\nwhich also provides that every High Court shall be a Court of record and shall consist of a Chief\\nJustice and such other Judges as the Governor General may from time to time deem it necessary to\\nappoint. The learned counsel has relied on the language of the provisions of the two sections referred\\nto above and has not produced any authority in support of the proposition he has put forward.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">3. We have carefully considered the argument addressed to us on this point and we think the objection\\nis not sound. There was to be a High Court for this Province from 5th April 1948, the prescribed\\nday. The Calcutta High Court, which formerly was exercising jurisdiction so far as this province was\\nconcerned was to cease to have that jurisdiction. The appointment of the Chief Justice was made\\nbefore the prescribed day, but under the proviso to S.3 it took effect from the prescribed day. The\\nappointment of such other Judges as the Governor-General deemed necessary within the maximum\\nlimit was no doubt necessary. But both S.3, Assam High Court Order, 1948 and S. 220, Government of\\nIndia Act, 1935 allow the Governor-General to make other appointments, from time to time. No time\\nlimit is placed on the exercise of jurisdiction vested in him in this respect. It cannot be said, therefore,\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">that the Governor-General was under an obligation to appoint Judges at once or at a time that they\\ncould function on the prescribed day or on any particular day. He is really the judge of the time when\\nappointments of other Judges may be made. Besides, the possibility that the Governor-General may\\ntake some time to make other appointments could not have been overlooked by the Legislature. If the\\nintention had been that the Chief Justice should not exercise the powers which he as Chief Justice\\nor as a single Judge of the High Court could exercise till these appointments were made an express\\nprovision to that effect should have appeared in the section. If the objection raised is accepted, the\\nconclusions would be that the Chief Justice could not act at all till at least the appointment of a second\\nJudge was made. This second appointment was made in August 1948. The result would be that the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">High Court could come into existence only in August though, according to the Assam High Court\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Order this province was to have a High Court from the prescribed day (5th April). The Calcutta High\\nCourt had ceased to exercise jurisdiction from that day. This result could not have been meant. The\\ninterpretation placed on the relevant section by the learned counsel leads to anomalous results. The\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Legislature could not have intended that the Chief Justice was not to exercise any jurisdiction even as\\nChief Justice or as a Single Judge till the appointment of other Judges. If this intention is attributed\\nto the Legislature, it would be reading something into the section that it does not contain.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4.  The  question,  however,  is  not  one  of  the  first  impression.  It  arose  before  a  Division  Bench  of\\nthe Patna High Court in Emperor v. Sohrai Koeri reported in AIR(25) 1938 Pat. 550 : (40 Cr.L.J.\\n41). A criminal case was argued before the learned Judges constituting the Bench. The hearing was\\nconcluded on 9th may and judgment was reserved. On 10th may news was received that Sir Courtney-\\nTerrell C.J., of the Court had died in England. On nth may, the objection was raised on behalf of the\\naccused that there being no chief justice, the High Court was not properly constituted and therefore\\nthe Bench too had ceased to have jurisdiction to pronounce judgment in the case. The objection was\\nbased on Cl. 2, Letters Patent of the Patna High Court by which it was declared that the High Court\\nshall consist of a chief justice and six other Judges. The Patna High Court was established under the\\nGovernment of India Act, 1915. At the time the objection was raised in the Patna High Court, the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Government of India Act, 1935, was in force. Clause 1 of S.220 of the Act which enacts that every\\nHigh Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and such other Judges as the Governor-General may from\\ntime to time deem it necessary to appoint was also considered. The Letters Patent of the Patna High\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Court did not provide for succession to the Chief Justice or other Judges if a vacancy occurred. But\\nas the Letters Patent were subject to the legislative power of the Governor-General in Legislative\\nCouncil,  the  situation  arising  from  the  happening  of  a  vacancy  was  to  be  dealt  with  u/S.  222,\\nGovernment of India Act, 1935. This section lays down that if the office of the Chief Justice of the\\nHigh Court becomes vacant, those duties shall, until some person appointed by His Majesty to the\\nvacant office has entered on the duties thereof, or until the Chief Justice has resumed his duties, as the\\ncase may be, be performed by such one of the other Judges of the Court as the Governor- General may\\nin his discretion think fit to appoint for the purpose. Even a temporary appointment by the Governor\\nGeneral would naturally take some time. The section, therefore, while taking note of the difficulty\\nwhich may arise from the happening of a vacancy provides the remedy by laying down that the duties\\nof the Chief Justice shall be performed by one of the other Judges whom the Governor- General may\\nin his discretion think fit to appoint for the purpose. The implication is that the jurisdiction of the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">High Court would not be affected. The vacancy in the office of the Chief Justice arising from death\\nor retirement would not affect the constitution of the Court. The jurisdiction of the other Judges also\\nwill not be affected. The duties of the Chief Justice could be performed by one of the other Judges\\nappointed for the purpose by the Governor General. In the interval till the appointment is made no\\nJudge of the High Court would be in a position to exercise the powers of the Chief Justice. But the\\nCourt will not loose its jurisdiction merely because there is a vacancy in the office of the Chief Justice.\\nThe office remains and therefore the constitution is not affected. By this process of the reasoning, the\\nlearned Judges of the Patna High Court came to the conclusion that where the office of a Chief Justice\\nof a High Court remains vacant due to death of the Chief Justice or other cause, it cannot be said\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">that till the vacancy is filled up there is no validly constituted High Court. Vacancy, in their opinion,\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">did not mean total abolition of that office; it amounts merely to a suspension of the duties to be dis.\\ncharged by a Chief Justice. .Other work and duties of the High Court could be carried on. If the High\\nCourt can remain properly constituted without a Chief Justice, it is obvious its constitution would not\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">be affected if the Governor-General was not able to appoint other Judges of this Court when the Chief\\nJustice was appointed. If the Chief Justice is the only judge of the High Court, he could perform the\\nduties of the Chief Justice. He could also dispose of such judicial business of the Court as he was\\nempowered to dispose of sitting singly, but the constitution of the Court could not be affected by\\ndelay in the appointment of other Judges required to be appointed u/S. 220, Government of India Act\\nor u/S.3, Assam High Court Order, 1948.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4a. . In Lalsingh v. Ghansham Singh, 9 ALL. 625 : (1887 A.W.N. 154 (F.B.)), the contention raised\\nwas that the Allahabad High Court was not properly constituted in as much as the number of Puisne\\nJudges was less than five. The Letters Patent of the High Court provided that the High Court was\\nto consist of the Chief Justice and five Puisne Judges. The omission to appoint the fifth Judge was\\nthe basis of the argument that the High Court was improperly constituted and therefore could not\\nexercise any jurisdiction till the appointment of a fifth Judge was made. The objection was overruled.\\nMahmood J. in the course of the argument observed as follows :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"The  fact  that  His  Majesty  has  omitted  for  several  years  to  till  up  a  vacancy  does  not  alter  the\\nconstitution of the Court or make it illegal nor does it amount to altering Cl. 2 of the Letters Patent.\\nIf your argument is correct, supposing a Judge was to die, the whole working of the Court would be\\nbrought to a standstill until his successor could be appointed.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">He even went further and remarked that even if the Crown was bound to fill up a vacancy within a\\nspecified time and acted illegally in not filling it up it did not follow that the constitution of the Court\\nis vitiated so as to deprive the remaining Judges of all other jurisdiction.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">5. In Collector of Etah v. Golab Kunwar, AIR(22) 1935 ALL. 322: (4 A.W.R.H.C. 79), the same\\nquestion arose in another form. The objection to the constitution of the Court was on the ground that\\nthe provisions contained in cl. i of S. 101 of the then Government of India Act had been contravened.\\nThe clause referred to above provided that at least one third of the Judges of the High Court shall be\\nbarristers, It was argued that on the appointment of one of the Pusine Judges of that Court as the Chief\\nJustice of the Lahore High Court, the constitution of the Allahabad High Court bad broken down as\\nno barrister Judge had been appointed in his place. Therefore the Chief Justice and other Judges lost\\nall their jurisdiction to dispose of their judicial work. The contention was overruled. It was pointed\\nout that if barrister Judge or a civilian Judge happens to die suddenly there is bound to be a vacancy\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">and the Government would naturally take some time to make a suitable appointment. If in the interval\\nthe High Court were to be with?out\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">any jurisdiction, some provision in the Government of India Act to that effect must have existed. If\\nit does not exist it cannot be read into the Act. The ratio decidendi in all these cases is the same and\\nwe are in respectful agreement with the view taken in these cases. The result is that the vacancy in\\nthe office of the Chief Justice or in the office of a Judge necessary for the Court does not affect the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">constitution or the jurisdiction of the Court. The High Court retains its jurisdiction and its function can\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">be carried even in the absence of a Chief Justice or other Judge or Judges necessary for the Court. In\\nthe absence of a Chief Justice it will not be possible for any one to perform his functions but the other\\nJudges of the Court could continue their work and the High Court could function as such. Similarly a\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Chief Justice could perform his duties and also discharge his function as a single Judge in the absence\\nof other Judges. The objection has got no force and is repelled.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">6. The second objection raised is that under R.15 of Chap v relating to general rules of procedure\\n(the Rules of the High Court of Judicature at Fort William in Bengal), an application of revision\\nmust be presented direct to a Division Bench. In this case, the petition was presented to the Chief\\nJustice alone and he issued the rule. The contention is that the presentation was invalid and the learned\\nChief Justice was not competent to issue the rule sitting singly. It is correct that the petition should\\nhave been presented to a Division Bench. But at the time the petition was put in there was only one\\nJudge of this Court functioning. No Division Bench could have been constituted. The petition in those\\ncircumstances could have been received only by the office for formal presentation before a Division\\nBench later. That procedure would have avoided technical objection. The presentation of the petition\\nto a single Judge and the issue of a rule by him, however, cannot be fatal to the petition. It is now\\nbefore a Division Bench. It can be taken as formally presented now and the issue of a further rule\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">can be dispensed with as the parties are before the Court and the record of the case is also available.\\nThere is thus no difficulty in the disposal of the petition. The learned counsel has pointed out that the\\npetition, if taken as presented now will be barred by time. There is no period of limitation provided\\nfor petitions of revision and if there had been any, this could be a very fit case for the condonation of\\ndelay as the petitioner is not guilty of any lathes or negligence. The petition was actually put in at a\\ntime when no objection on the score of limitation could have been taken. The objection is overruled.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7. The facts bearing on the contentions, raised in the petition may now be briefly stated.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">8.  Plaintiffs  (opposite  parties  1-4)  instituted  a  suit  for  recovery  of  Rs.  70,000  by  the  sale  of  the\\nmortgaged property against the representatives of the mortgagors and other persons. interested in the\\nequity of redemption on 2nd January 1941. It took about six months to get written statement from\\nthe defendants. On 14th November 1941, an interim order staying further proceedings, in the suit\\nwas issued by the Calcutta High Court. This was vacated on 19th June 1942. In pursuance of another\\norder by the High Court, a commission for the examination of a woman was issued. It was received\\nback unexecuted on 14th December 1942. On 18th December 1942, the suit was fixed for peremptory\\nhearing on 9th January 1943, The order was communicated to the counsel for the plaintiffs on 21st\\nDecember 1942. The plaintiffs got the information about the order on 29th, December 1942. They had\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">already left for their native place in the district of Arah in Bihar in November 1942. For reasons given\\nin their application for adjournment of the case presented on 9th January, they applied for adjournment\\nthrough their counsel. The adjournment was refused. The counsel then withdrew from the case as\\nhe had no further instructions and the suit was dismissed for default on that date. On 8th February\\n1943, plaintiffs applied for restoration of the suit under O.9, R.9. They explained their inability to\\narrange for the prosecution of the suit on 9th January 1943, by stating that when the date for hearing\\nwas fixed, they were in Arah District in Bihar. Further, before getting information about the date of\\nhearing, plaintiffs 1 and 4 had fixed the dates for the marriages of their sons. These marriages were\\nto be celebrated on 16th and 19th January 1943, respectively. They could not, therefore, arrange to\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">produce evidence on 9th January and then go back to their native district in Bihar in time to arrange\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">for the celebration of marriages. Plaintiff 2 who was ill, had sent a medical certificate which was\\npresented to the Court when the request for the adjournment of the case was made on plaintiffs\\' behalf.\\nPlaintiff 3 was said to be a chronic invalid.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">9. On 29th march 1943, Mr. I. Rasul, who had dismissed the suit for default, ordered its restoration.\\nHe was inclined to the view that no sufficient cause prevented the plaintiffs from appearing in Court\\non 9th January, but in view of the statement of defendant 1, in para. 8 of the written statement and for\\nthe ends of justice, he agreed to set aside the order of dismissal\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of the suit and directed it to be restored to the file.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">10. Defendant 1 challenged the correctness of the order by a revision petition in the High Court at\\nFort William. The case came before a Division Bench of the High Court. The learned Judges held\\nthat the order of restoration was passed\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"under a vague mixture of reasons, partly for reasons which are for consideration under O.9, R.9 of\\nthe Code, and partly for reasons which would justify action u/S.151, and the parties have been put\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">into some difficulties.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">In these circumstances they held that instead of their diposing of the case on the merits, it was more\\nsuitable that the case should go back for a proper order to be passed by the Court below. The learned\\nJudges laid down that the Court could not restore the case under its inherent powers u/S.151 of the\\nCode, if it found that there was no sufficient cause for restoration within the meaning of O.9, R.9. The\\ncase was, therefore, remanded to the lower Court for disposal of the application under O.9 R.9 on the\\nevidence already on the record. The Court was further directed to come to a clear finding one way or\\nthe other whether it considered or did not consider that there was sufficient cause for non-appearance\\non 9th January and to restore the case or reject the application accordingly.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">11. On remand, the case again came before Mr. I. Rasul. He rejected the petition under O.9, R.9\\nholding  that  sufficient  cause  was  not  shown  for  non-appearance  of  the  plaintiffs  on  9th  January.\\nPlaintiffs preferred an appeal againt this order to the High Court. It was held in appeal that the learned\\nJudge had not heard the parties or their pleader before dis. posing of the case after remand. The order\\nrejecting the application was set aside. The learned Judge was directed to dispose of the application\\nunder O.9, 11. 9 according to law and in the light of observations made in previous order of remand.\\nHe was also directed to hear the pleader of the parties or parties themselves before disposing of finally\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the application for restoration of the suit.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">12. When this case was received back, Mr. Rasul had been transferred and the petition was disposed\\nof by Mr. D.N. Hazarika, Spl. Sub-Judge, his successor in office. He felt satisfied that there was\\nsufficient cause for the non-appearance of the plaintiffs on the date of hearing and setting aside the\\ndismissal of the suit ordered its restoration on 13th march 1948. The plaintiff petitioners were directed\\nto pay Rs.50 to the opposite party as costs within a month from the date of the order.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">13. Defendant 1 had again come up on revision to this Court against this order.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">14. The first contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that Mr. D.N. Hazarika bad\\nno jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the petition. He contended that the case had been remanded for\\ndisposal by Mr. Rasul, who had dismissed the suit for default and bad later restored it. His order being\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">vague it had to be set aside. It is urged that considering the reasons on which the order of Mr. Rasul\\ndated 29th march 1943 was set aside the intention of the High Court was that Mr. Rasul alone should\\ndispose of the petition by a proper order. We have been taken through the whole of the order and its\\nsubstance has been reproduced above. The main reason why this order was set aside was that it was\\nnot clear whether in the view of the Judge sufficient cause had been shown for non-appearance on 9th\\nJanuary 1943 or not. There were observations in the order of the learned Sub-Judge which indicated\\nthat he was making use of his inherent jurisdiction u/S. 151. Since the order was not clear, the case\\nwas remanded. But in the Last paragraph of the order, which embodies the directions of the Court, it\\nwas said that the case is remanded to the \\'lower Court\\' for disposal of the application on the merits\\nand on the evidence already on record. We are not prepared to read in this order any direction that the\\ncase was to be disposed of by Mr. Rasul and not by his successor.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">15. The second order of remand merely directs that parties must be heard before the disposal of the\\ncase. In all other respects, the previous order of remand was allowed to remain in tact and was to be\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">followed. In these circumstances, the contention has got no force.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">16. The learned counsel has relied on two authorities viz., Bhoyro Lal v. Mokoond Lal, 2 Suther\\n275 and Bhyrub v. Khettur Mohun, 5 suther 124, in support of his contention. These cases have no\\napplication to the facts of the case before us. In both these cases, the remand orders directed the Judges\\nof the Court below to give their reasons for their decisions which they had omitted to state. There was\\nto be no rehearing of the matter. In the present case, the direction in the order of remand was that the\\napplication be disposed of according to law after hearing the parties. These authorities, therefore, do\\nnot assist the petitioner in any way.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">17. The second contention raised is that the order of the special Sub-Judge is without jurisdiction\\nin asmuch as all defendants were not properly served. It is admitted that the petitioner was served,\\nappeared, and was heard. But, it is contended that service in the case of\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">defendants 9-12 had not been duly effected and therefore the Court could not dispose of the petition in\\ntheir absence. It appears that after the last order of remand, substituted service was effected on these\\ndefendants, The process-server\\'s report was verified by an affidavit. This is not denied. The learned\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">counsel points out that after the verification of the report by the process server, the Court should have\\ndeclared that the summons had been duly served under O.5, R.19. The failure on the part of the Court\\nto record an order declaring that service had been duly effected deprived it of all jurisdiction to dispose\\nof the petition. He has not cited any authority in support of this proposition. It is a question whether\\ndeclaration of due service under R.19 must be in express terms. There is a conflict of authority on the\\npoint. But even if it is assumed for purpose of argument that an express declaration of due service is\\nnecessary, the omission to declare due service under the rule would be an irregularity on the basis of\\nwhich the party adversely affected by the omission may ask for an opportunity to be heard. It would\\nnot affect the jurisdiction of the Court as regards parties that are present before the Court. The learned\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">counsel for the petitioner could not cite any authority in support of the proposition that the order of\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the Court below would be wholly without jurisdiction merely because there was no declaration of\\ndue service in respect of some defendants who are not challenging the order and against whom the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">order has already become final. It is worthy of note that defendants, on whom substituted service\\nwas effected, included a representative of a mortgagor and some mortgagees. They did not contest\\nthe petition for restoration of the suit at any stage. They have been served on this petition and have\\nnot appeared. It is clear that they are not feeling aggrieved by the order. The petitioner cannot take\\nadvantage of the irregularity, if any, as it is not possible to hold that the order of the Court below was\\nwithout jurisdiction as contended by his learned counsel even as regards parties who were present\\nand were heard.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">18. We are not convinced that the declaration of due service in express terms is impetrative. We are\\ninclined to the view taken by Oudh Chief Court, Harcharam v. Md. Azizullah, AIR(19) 1932 Oudh\\n326: (141 I.C.759) and the Lahore High Court, Tehal Singh v. Chainchal Singh, AIR(21) 1934 Lah.\\n985. The declaration may be implied in the proceedings. Where such a declaration exists though by\\nnecessary implication, there would be no irregularity in the service and proceedings in the Court below\\nwill not be open to any objection. Now if Court had not been satisfied that the service on defendants 9\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">to 12 had been effected duly it would have ordered fresh service. This was not done. The implication,\\ntherefore, is obvious and deprives the objection of all its force.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">19. The last contention is that sufficient cause for non-appearance was not made out and the order\\nof the Special Sub-Judge was not sustainable as it took judicial notice of certain facts against the\\nprovisions contained in the Evidence Act and also relied on a medical certificate which had not been\\nproved according to law. It is correct that the Court should not have taken judicial notice of the fact\\nthat railway travel at the time (January, 43) was uncertain. This was a matter for proof. Similarly, the\\nunproved medical certificate could not be considered as evidence. But even if the medical certificate is\\nnot taken into consideration and the un-certainities of railway travel in January 1943 are not presumed,\\nthe order is not liable to interference. The learned Judge came to a definite conclusion that one of the\\nplaintiffs was a chronic invalid. Another was ill. There was oral evidence about his illness, which the\\nlearned Judge did not reject. The other two plaintiffs according to evidence, had left Assam before\\nthe middle of November 1942. They learned about the hearing on 29th December. They had already\\nmade arrangements for celebrating the marriages of their sons on 16th and 19th January 1943. In these\\ncircumstances, in his view, it was extremely difficult for them to attend the Court on 19th January and\\nthen go back to their native district and make arrangements for two marriages. We think he was right\\nin taking this view of the matter. The case had been proceeding at a very slow pace. When leaving\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the jurisdiction of the Court plaintiffs had no idea that the case will be fixed for a peremptory hearing\\nso early. In view of the circumstances in which they found themselves, their request for adjournment\\nwas reasonable. Plaintiffs took some risk in applying for adjournment, without making arrangements\\nfor the prosecution of the case in the hope that they will get it, But for this, a suit in which such a huge\\nsum is being claimed need not have been dismissed. They could have been ordered to pay costs. As\\nheld by the Subordinate Judge, there is no basis for the view that plaintiffs were absent wilfully or\\nwithout any reasonable cause. It is possible to arrive at this finding without taking judicial notice of the\\nconditions of railway travel at the time and without taking into consideration the medical certificate\\nobjected to by the learned counsel.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">20. We have, thus, no basis for interference with the finding of the Court below that sufficient cause\\nfor nonappearance has been made\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">out, The order advances substantial justice and gives the parties a chance to have their disputes settled\\non the merits. We, therefore, decline to interfere. The petition is dismissed with costs.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Thadani, Ag. C.

The defendant was a resident of Dadva of Umrala Mahal of the Bhavnagar State, and he did\\nnot appeal after service of summons and the decree was passed ex parte. The decree was kept alive\\nby taking out execution proceedings from time to time in the Vala Court, and on the formation of the\\nUnited State of Kathiawar, which later became the Saurashtra State, and after the integration of the\\nVala State into the said United State of Kathiawar on 8th March 1948, the decree-holder applied to the\\nMunsiff\\'s Court at Vala on 3rd June 1950 for transferring the decree to the Court of the Civil Judge,\\nShihor-Umrala for the execution and accordingly the decree was transferred to the latter Court.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Held that (i) the question of the competency of a court to entertain a suit and to pass a decree and\\nof the said decree being a valid decree has to be judged by the municipal law. The Code of Civil\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Procedure, which was applicable in Vala was the same as the Code of Civil Procedure in British India\\nand under Section 20(c) of the said Code, the Vala Court had the jurisdiction to entertain and decide\\nthe suit against a non-resident foreigner as the cause of action arose within the local limits of its\\njurisdiction by reason of the fact that the khata had been executed by the defendant within those limits.\\nTherefore, so far as the competency of the Vala Court to pass a decree in that suit was concerned the\\nsaid Court was a Court of competent jurisdiction. That being so it was a valid and binding decree. The\\nquestion of the enforcement or the execution of the decree is a distinct one and it is when execution\\nof the decree is sought in a foreign Court that private international law comes into play and the decree\\nbecomes unenforceable against a non-resident foreigner who has not submitted to the jurisdiction\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">of the decreeing Court. Whether Vala and the Bhavnagar States merged together or whether these\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">two States along with several other States merged together and created a new State, the Vala Court\\nceased to be a foreign Court qua the Bhavnagar Court.

The appellant obtained a money decree against\\nthe respondent on 15th September 1937 in suit No.46 of 1937-38 brought in the Court of the former\\nVala State on the strength of a Khata executed by the respondent. The defendant was a resident of\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Dadva of Umrala Mahal of the Bhavnagar State, and he did not appear after service of Summons and\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the decree was passed ex parte.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The decree was kept alive by taking out execution proceedings from time to time in the Vala Court,\\nand on the formation of the United State of Kathiawar, which later became the Saurashtra State, and\\nafter the integration of the Vala State into the said United State of Kathiawar on 8th March 1943, the\\ndecree-holder applied to the Munsiff\\'s Court at Vala on 3rd June 1950 for transferring the decree to the\\nCourt of the Civil Judge, Shihor-Umrala for the execution and accordingly the decree was transferred\\nto the latter Court. The judgment-debtor having been served with a notice, he contended that he was\\nresiding in Dadva under the jurisdiction of the Bhavnagar State, that he had not submitted to the\\njurisdiction of the Vala Court, that the decree passed was against a non-resident foreigner and was\\ntherefore a nullity, and that it could not be executed. It was also urged that the decree-holder ought to\\nhave filed a suit on the strength of the Khata in the Bhavnagar Court within the period of limitation\\nand that such a suit was now barred by time. It was contended that the judgment-debtor had obtained\\na vested right to resist the decree of a foreign Court and that he could not be deprived of that right.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">2. The learned Civil Judge held that the decree of the Vala Court being an ex parte decree against a\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">non-resident foreigner was a nullity and could not be executed and that the judgment-debtor could\\nnot be deprived of the valuable right which he had acquired of resisting the suit, if such a suit had\\nbeen brought in a Court of the Bhavnagar State. He also rejected the contention urged on behalf of the\\ndecree-holder that by reason of the formation of the Saurashtra State by the integration of the former\\nStates of Kathiawar, the decree now becomes a decree obtained in the Court of the Saurashtra State\\nand was for that reason executable in any other Court of the said State. In this view he dismissed the\\nDarkhast. In appeal, the learned District Judge agreed with the lower Court that the judgment-debtor\\nhad acquired a valuable right to plead the bar of limitation against the claim, and that he could not be\\ndeprived of the said right by reason of the merger of the States into the Saurashtra State, and in this\\nview the learned judge dismissed the appeal.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">3. A preliminary objection was taken by Mr. Oza for the respondent that as the amount in the suit\\nwas less than Rs.500 no second appeal lies by virtue of Section 102 Civil Procedure Code. The term\\n\\'suit\\' in this Section includes execution proceedings so that if no second appeal lay from the decree,\\nthen no second appeal would also lie against an order passed in execution. We will presume that the\\nsuit was of a nature cognisable by the Small Cause Court and that Section 102 Civil Procedure Code\\napplies. In that case, no doubt no second appeal would lie. However we can treat this appeal as a\\nRevision Application and proceed to consider the questions raised, and we do accordingly treat it as\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">a Revision application.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4. Now it is admitted that the decree in question was passed against a non-resident foreigner who did\\nnot submit to the jurisdiction of the Vala Court and ordinarily the decree-holder\\'s remedy would have\\nbeen to bring a suit on the strength of a foreign judgment in the Court of the Bhavnagar State within\\nwhose jurisdiction the judgment-debtor was residing; and this might well have been the position in\\nthe present case had it not been for the historical event of the formation of the Saurashtra State in\\nwhich the former States of Vala and Bhavnagar and other States of Kathiawar integrated. The Code of\\nCivil Procedure, which was applicable in Vala was the same as the Code of Civil Procedure in British\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">India and under Section 20(c) of the said Code, the Vala Court had the jurisdiction to entertain and\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">decide the suit against a non-resident foreigner as the cause of action arose within the local limits of\\nits jurisdiction by reason of the fact that the Khata had been executed by the defendant within those\\nlimits. Therefore, so far as the competency of the Vala Court to pass a decree in that suit is concerned,\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">it cannot be disputed that the said Court was a Court of competent jurisdiction. That being so it was\\na valid and binding decree,\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">A similar question came to be considered in - \\'Chunilal Kasturchand v. Dundappa Damappa\\', AIR\\n1951 Bom 190. There the decree was obtained by the plaintiffs in the Court of the Civil Judge, Senior\\nDivision, Belgaum against several defendants some of whom did not reside within the jurisdiction\\nof the Belgaum Court and so the leave of the Court was obtained under Section 20(b) of the Code\\nof Civil Procedure. The cause of action had arisen within the jurisdiction of the Belgaum Court. The\\nsuit was ultimately decreed against all the defendants in March 1938. Execution of the decree was\\ntaken out in 1940 in the Belgaum Court and the Darkhast was transferred for execution to the Court\\nof the Subordinate Judge, Jamkhandi, which was then a native State. However it appears that there\\nwas a reciprocity by virtue of which decrees of a Civil Court in British India could be executed in the\\nState Courts as if they were the decrees passed by Civil Courts of the Jamkhandi State. The judgment-\\ndebtor contended that it being an ex parte decree passed against him by the Belgaum Court, it could\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">not be executed against him by the Jamkhandi Court, and this plea having been accepted by the trial\\nCourt and the trial Court having dismissed the Darkhast, an appeal was taken to the High Court.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">5. Dealing with the question, Mr. Justice Rajadhyaksha held that the Belgaum Court did have the\\njurisdiction to pass a decree as the cause of action arose in its territorial limits. The competency of a\\nCourt to try a suit had to be determined according to the Municipal Law and the learned Judge cited -\\n\\'Rambhat v. Shankar Baswant\\', 3 Bom. L.R. 82 where it was held that under the Civil Procedure Code\\n(Act XIV of 1882) British Courts are empowered to pass judgments against non-resident foreigner\\nprovided  that  the  cause  of  action  has  arisen  within  the  jurisdiction  of  the  Court  pronouncing  the\\njudgment. - \\'Gaekwar Baroda State Rly. v. Habib Ullah\\', AIR 1934 All. 740 was also referred to with\\napproval and reference was also made to - \\'Girdhar Damodar v. Kassigar Hiragar\\', 17 Bom. 662. On a\\nconsideration of these authorities, the learned Judge held that the decree of the Belgaum Court was a\\ngood decree and could be executed against any property belonging to the judgment-debtors anywhere\\nwithin the territory which was formerly known as British India. As the learned Judge observed, the\\ndifficulty, however arose because that decree was sought to be executed in Jamkhandi Court and\\nagainst a person who, at the time of the decree, was a non-resident foreigner. The said decree, as\\nwas  obvious,  was  a  decree  of  a  foreign  Court,  and  in  the  learned  Judge\\'s  opinion,  when  it  came\\nto the question of executing the decree against a non-resident foreigner, who did not submit to the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">jurisdiction of the decreeing Court, the decree as against him could not be treated as a decree passed\\nby a Court of competent jurisdiction. However by reason of a subsequent event, viz., the merger of\\nthe Jamkhandi State into the Province of Bombay, the Belgaum Court could not be considered as a\\nforeign court for the purpose of the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">execution proceedings pending in the Jamkhandi Court and the decree could be executed.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">6. Mr. Justice Shah, who wrote a concurring judgment, put the position more explicitly and observed\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">that the decree passed by the Belgaum Court was binding upon those defendants who were British\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Indian Nationals, and was also binding upon all defendants residing within the limits of what then\\nwas British India. The learned Judge observed :-\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"But the competency of the Court of the First Class Subordinate Judge at Belgaum to try the suit either\\nby reason of the cause of action arising within the limits of the Court or by reason of the leave granted\\nby the Court could not render the decree one passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction so as to make\\nit enforceable against the respondent who was a foreigner and was not ordinarily residing within the\\njurisdiction of the Court which passed the decree and who had not submitted to the jurisdiction of\\nthe court. It is well settled that even where there are reciprocity agreements under which decrees of\\nCourts of one State are enforceable by Courts of another State, a judgment-debtor is entitled to raise\\nall contentions which he could have raised if a suit had been filed on a foreign judgment.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">After referring to - \\'Gurdyal Singh v. Rajah of Faridkote\\', 22 Cal 222 (P.C), and other cases the learned\\nJudge ultimately observed :-\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"In my view the competency of a Court to entertain an action and to pass a decree may be judged\\nby the municipal law of the State when that question arises in a Court within the limits of the State\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">which has constituted the Court which entertains the suit or passes the decree and is not to be judged\\nby applying rules of international law. But where a question arises as to the enforcement of a decree\\nor order passed by a Court in another territory, the rules of international law must prevail.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Agreeing with Mr. Justice Rajadhyaksha on the question of the effect of the change of circumstances\\nresulting in the merger of the Jamkhandi State with the province of Bombay, the learned Judge held\\nthat the status of the judgment-debtor was changed by reason of the said merger, and he was no longer\\na foreigner with reference to the Belgaum Court and the Court in which execution was sought was\\nno longer a Court of a foreign State.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The learned Judge observed :-\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"Consequently, the rule of private international law that a decree of a Court cannot be executed in a\\nforeign Court against a person who was qua the Court which passed the decree a non-resident foreigner\\nis no longer of any application. The rule of private international law has remained the same, but its\\noperation in so far as it concerns the Court in which execution is sought is altered. The judgment-\\ndebtor may well be entitled to resist execution of the decree of a court of a State which at the date when\\nexecution is sought is a Court of a foreign State, but he is no longer entitled to resist the execution of\\na decree of the Belgaum Court which is not the decree of a Court of a foreign State.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7. Both the learned Judges also rejected the contention urged on behalf of the judgment-debtor that\\nhe had a right to resist the execution of a decree of a foreign Court, that this was a substantive right,\\nand that it could not be taken away, and they held that it was not in consequence of any change of\\nlaw, but as a result of an act of State that the judgment-debtor lost his former status and was from\\n25th February 1948 (the material date in that case) onwards a national of the Indian Union and a\\ncitizen of the Dominion of India. Therefore the principles which apply to the construction of a statute\\nwhich affects devested rights could not be applied to the alteration of the status of an individual by\\nan act of State.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">8. This judgment was considered by a Full Bench of the Bombay High Court in - \\'Bhagwan Shanker v.\\nRajaram\\', AIR 1951 Bom 125 (FB), and the question referred to the Full Bench was in the following\\nterms :-\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"Whether a decree passed by a foreign Court against a person who has not submitted to its jurisdiction\\ncan ever become enforceable by reason of any subsequent event and whether - \\'Chunilal Kasturchand\\nv. Dundappa Damappa\\', (AIR 1951 Bom 190) to the extent that it decides this point, was rightly\\ndecided.\"  There  the  plaintiff  Bhagwan  had  obtained  an  ex  parte  money  decree  in  the  Court  of\\nthe  Subordinate  Judge,  Sholapur,  on  13th  September  1937  against  defendant  Rajaram,  who  was\\na  permanent  resident  of  a  village  in  the  Akalkot  State.  The  said  defendant  did  not  submit  to  the\\njurisdictions  of  the  Sholapur  Court.  The  decree  was  transferred  for  execution  to  the  Court  of  the\\nNyayadhish of the Akalkot State, and then an application was made on 9th June 1945 to the Akalkot.\\nCourt for execution. The application was dismissed and this order was confirmed by the District Judge\\nof Akalkot on 8th June 1948. Meanwhile the Akalkot State had merged into the Bombay State. Dealing\\nwith the question whether the Sholapur Court had the right to exercise jurisdiction upon a non-resident\\nforeigner, Chagla, C.J. held that Section 20(c) of the Civil Procedure Code clearly contemplates that\\na Court in British India may entertain a suit against a non-resident foreigner if the cause of action has\\naccrued within jurisdiction wholly or in part.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The learned Chief Justice observed :-\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"It is perfectly true that ordinarily Courts all over the world exercise jurisdiction only against persons\\nwho are within their jurisdiction and whom they can reach with the arm of the law. It would be futile\\nfor a Court to assume jurisdiction when it cannot issue process against the party against whom it is\\nseeking jurisdiction. But special laws make exceptions and one of the exceptions is to be found in\\nSection 20(e) where, as we said before, the Legislature has conferred upon the Courts in India the\\nright to proceed against non-resident foreigners although they are not within reach of the processes\\nof that Court. Therefore, we have clearly this position that the decree passed by the Sholapur Court\\nwas not a nullity. It is equally true that if the defendant who was a citizen of Akalkot and therefore\\na foreigner qua the Sholapur Court did not submit to the jurisdiction of the Sholapur Court and did\\nnot acquiesce in the jurisdiction, then the decree passed by the Sholapur Court could not be enforced\\nwhen it was transferred for execution to the Akalkot Court. The true view of the matter is not that\\nthe decree was a nullity, but its enforcement or executability was limited to the Sholapur Court and\\nit could not be executed or enforced in a foreign territory because the defendant had not submitted\\nto the jurisdiction of the Sholapur Court.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The principle of private international law, which is embodied in Section 13(a), is that a Court will not\\nenforce the judgment of a foreign, Court if that judgment is of a Court which is not a competent Court\\nand for the purpose of competency in private international law a Court\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">is never competent when it passes a judgment against a non-resident foreigner who has not submitted\\nto its jurisdiction. Therefore, as far as this particular decree was concerned, as the defendant, we are\\nassuming, did not submit to the jurisdiction of the Sholapur Court qua the Akaikot Court the judgment\\nof the Sholapur Court was a foreign judgment passed by a Court not of competent jurisdiction and\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">therefore  the  decree  could  not  be  executed  in  the  Akaikot  Court  so  long  as  the  Sholapur  Court\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">continued to be a foreign Court.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">But  once  it  is  conceded  that  the  decree  was  not  a  nullity  and  it  was  valid  and  binding  as  far  as\\nthe Sholapur Court was concerned, then there is no difficulty, with respect, in understanding and\\nappreciating the judgment, which we have to consider in this Pull Bench because if the character\\nof the Akalkot Court changes and if the status of the defendant alters because of that fact, then the\\nimpediment which was initially there, in the decree being enforced in the Akalkot Court disappears\\nand  the  decree  which  was  unenforceable  till  that  change  came  about  becomes  enforceable  and\\nexecutable in the Akalkot Court. This is not in any way violating private international law. Private\\ninternational law remains the same. But under the circumstances of the case the Sholapur Court no\\nlonger being a foreign Court qua the Akalkot Court the question of private international law does not\\narise at all. The decree is then being executed under the Municipal law and clearly under the Municipal\\nlaw the decree is executable as it has been passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction\".\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">The following observations of the Privy Council in - Gurdyal Singh v. Raja of Faridkot\\', 22 Cal 222\\n(P.C.) were quoted :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"In a personal action, to which none of these causes of jurisdiction apply, a decree pronounced in\\nabsentum by a foreign Court, to the jurisdiction of which the defendant has not in any way submitted\\nhimself, is by international law an absolute nullity. He is under no obligation of any kind to obey it;\\nand it must be regarded as a mere nullity by the Courts of every nation except (when authorised by\\nspecial local legislation) in the country of the forum by which it was pronounced\".\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">These observations were considered and reconciled and the learned Chief Justice took the view that\\nthe decree in question was not an absolute nullity because something which is an absolute nullity\\ncan never be enforced in any part of the world under any circumstances; but the Privy Council itself\\ncontemplates that such a decree can be enforced in the forum by which it was passed provided special\\nlocal legislation authorises that forum. The decree is a valid decree but it is not enforceable in Courts\\nother than Courts where it was passed by reason of private international law.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">9. With respect, I agree with the view taken in both these Bombay decisions. The question of the\\ncompetency of a Court to entertain a suit and to pass a decree and of the said decree, being a valid\\ndecree,  has  to  be  judged  by  the  municipal  law.  Section  20(c)  of  the  Civil  Procedure  Code  does\\nempower a Court to hear a suit if the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises in the local limits of its\\njurisdiction, so that the decree of the Vala Court in this case was a decree of a competent Court and\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">therefore a valid decree. The question of the enforcement or the execution of the decree is a distinct\\none and it is when execution of the decree is sought in a foreign Court that private international law\\ncomes into play and the decree becomes unenforceable against a non-resident foreigner who has not\\nsubmitted to the jurisdiction of the decreeing Court. With respect, I also agree with the view taken\\nby  the  learned  Judges  of  the  Bombay  High  Court  in  the  above  two  decisions  that  the  position  is\\ncompletely altered on account of an act of State by which the Jamkhandi State in the one case and\\nthe Akalkot State in the other case came to be merged in the Province of Bombay, and by reason of\\nthat act of State the decree no longer remained a decree of a foreign Court qua the said States. It is\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">true that in the case before us the merger is not of the Vala and the Bhavnagar States only, but the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">merger is of all the States of Kathiawar who by a Covenant integrated themselves into one new State\\ncalled the United State of Kathiawar, but that does not make any difference to the rule accepted in\\nthese Bombay decisions.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Whether  Vala  and  the  Bhavnagar  States  merged  together  or  whether  these  two  States  along  with\\nseveral other States merged together and created a new State, the fact does remain that the Vala Court\\nceases to be a foreign Court qua the Bhavnagar Court. In fact both these Courts and the Courts of\\nseveral other States became the Courts of one State, now the Saurashtra State. The character of the\\nBhavnagar Court changes and so does the status of the defendant alter because of this historical fact\\nof the integration of the States into a common State of Saurashtra. The decree, the execution of which\\nis now sought, therefore, no longer remains a decree of a foreign Court qua the Bhavnagar Courts.\\nIts execution has been sought under the municipal law and no question of the operation of private\\ninternational law now arises. Under the municipal law the decree is executable because it has been\\npassed by a Court of competent jurisdiction.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">10. There is also another and a more direct reason on account of which the decree in question of\\nthe Vala Court is executable by the Shihor-Umrala Court. On the formation of the United State of\\nKathiawar in March 1948 the Raj Pramukh promulgated Ordinance No.IV of 1948 on 6th March\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">1948 and Section 5 thereof enacted that save as otherwise expressly provided, any suit, appeal or\\napplication filed in any Court, any decree or order passed, any process issued or any proceeding taken\\nunder any law, rule, regulation or order in force in the said States, meaning the Covenanting States,\\non the date of the making over of the said States, shall be deemed to have been filed, passed, issued\\nor taken under the said law, rule, regulation, or order as continued in force by Section 4 of Ordinance\\nNo.1 of 1948. Section 4 of Ordinance No.IV of 1948 lays down that Courts, other than the Courts\\nexercising the powers of a High Court and jurisdiction conferred or any Court under any law, rule,\\nregulation or order made by competent authority of the State prior to the date of the Covenant shall be\\ndeemed to have been made, constituted or conferred by the competent authority of the Government\\nof Saurashtra. The effect of these two provisions is that the Vala Court shall from the date of this\\nOrdinance be deemed to be a Court constituted by the Government of Saurashtra, and its decrees shall\\nbe deemed to have been passed by a Court of the Saurashtra State.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Then Ordinance No.XI of 1948 was promulgated on 5th April 1948 for providing for District and\\nother subordinate Civil Courts in the State of Saurashtra. By Section 2 (1) thereof all District and\\nother Civil Subordinate Courts established or continued under the provisions of any other law were\\nabolished, and by sub-section (2) it was provided\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">that all proceedings pending on the date of the said Ordinance shall be taken cognisance of by Civil\\nCourts established under the ordinance and all proceedings disposed of by the Civil Courts mentioned\\nin sub-section (1), meaning the Courts which were abolished, were to be deemed to have been disposed\\nof by the Courts established under this ordinance. Therefore, the decree&gt; in question must be deemed\\nto have been passed by the Vala Court established under this Ordinance, viz., the present Court of\\nVala and this decree is therefore executable by the Shihor-Umrala Court just as the decrees passed\\nby the Vala Court after the formation of the State of Saurashtra are executable in other Courts of\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the Saurashtra State. Both the Lower Courts were therefore wrong in refusing the execution of the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">decree in question.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">11.  Mr.  Oza  for  the  respondent  also  raised  the  contention  which  was  raised  and  considered  in  -\\n\\'Chunilal Kasturchand v. Dundappa Damappa\\', (AIR 1951 Bom 190) and in - \\'Bhagwan Shanker v.\\nRajaram,\\' (AIR 1951 Bom. 125 F.B.) viz., that the defendant had a vested right to resist the decree\\nof a foreign Court and that vested right could not be taken away. The contention was rejected by\\nall the learned Judges on the simple ground that although the Civil Procedure Code of the former\\nStates has been repealed, Section 13(a) has taken its place in identical terms, and therefore, whatever\\nprejudice has been occasioned has not been caused by the repeal of any legislation. The prejudice has\\nbeen caused by an act of State which alters the status of the decreeing Court and also the status of\\nthe defendant and makes the decreeing Court a municipal Court and the defendant a citizen, whereas\\nformerly the decreeing Court was a foreign Court and the defendant was a foreigner. Precisely the\\nsame considerations apply to the present case by virtue of the Covenant entered into by the Rulers\\nof the Covenanting States, and the formation of the United State of Saurashtra. The Courts of those\\nStates cease to be foreign Courts and the residents of one State qua the other cease to be foreigners.\\nNo question of the deprivation of the vested right by repeal of any legislation can therefore arise in\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">this case.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">12. In the result therefore, we allow this revision application, set aside the order of the lower Courts\\nand remand the case to the Court of the Civil Judge, Shihor-Umrala to proceed with the execution\\nof the decree according to law.

Mr. S.N. Dwivedi has appeared on behalf of the applicant and from the facts given by him it appears\\nthat the applicant has been in lawful custody at least from 15th December 1918. The applicant was\\narrested on 19th November 1948, for breach of an order passed under S. 144, Criminal P.C. He was\\ngranted bail but on 15th December 1948, he was re-arrested for breach of an order passed under S.\\n3(1)(f). U. P. Maintenance of Public Order (Temporary) Act (IV [4] of 1947). It appears that by an\\norder passed in October, 1948, he was directed not to take part in certain activities and was required to\\nexecute a personal bond in a sum of Rs. 1,000 and two sureties for Rs. 600 each. The applicant failed to\\ncarry out this order and a case was thereafter started against him for breach of the said order and from\\n15th December, 1948, he was in custody as an under-trial prisoner. On 7th January 1949, the applicant\\nwas convicted under S. 188, Penal Code for breach of the order under S. 141, Criminal P.C., and was\\nsentenced to one month\\'s rigorous imprisonment. So with effect from 7th January 1949, the applicant\\nwas undergoing the sentence of one month. This sentence expired on 7th February 1949, but he was\\ndetained in custody as an under-trial prisoner in the case under S. 3, sub-s. (7), U. P. Maintenance of\\nPublic Order (Temporary) Act. He did not apply for bail and on 25th April 1949, be was sentenced\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">to six months\\' rigorous imprisonment and is now undergoing that sentence. It would appear from\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the above narrative of facts that the applicant has been in custody as an under-trial prisoner and has\\nbeen undergoing the sentence passed by a Court in accordance with law from 15th December 1948.\\nThere can, therefore, be no question of any unlawful detention, nor can an application by the applicant\\nfor a writ of habeas corpus for his production on the ground that he has been illegally detained be\\nentertained.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">3. Learned counsel has informed us that on 7th March 1949, an order was passed by the Provincial\\nGovernment under S. 3(1)(a), U. P. Maintenance of Public Order (Temporary) Act (IV [4] of 1947)\\ndirecting his detention for a period of six months. It is the legality of that order that the applicant\\nis questioning by his application under S. 491, Criminal P.C. The mere fact that an illegal order,\\nassuming that the order passed was illegal, had been passed against a prisoner, does not give him a\\nright to apply for a writ of habeas corpus unless he had been taken in custody or his movements had\\nbeen restricted by reason of that order. A writ of habeas corpus can only be asked for on the ground\\nthat a person has been kept under illegal detention. If there is no illegal detention there is no right\\nunder S. 491, Criminal P.C., to move this Court for determination of the question whether a particular\\norder is valid or invalid.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">4.

The suit instituted by the plaintiff, Joygobinda Prasad Shah, against Dwarikaprosad Shah and it\\nothers, upon a registered mortgage-bond executed by the father of defendant 1 on 30th September\\n1929, whereby he mortgaged certain lands and houses in favour of the plain. tiff as security for a\\nloan of Rs. 8244-3-0 with interest at the rate of 10 per cent. per annum. During the subsistence of the\\nmortgage, he transferred some of the mortgaged properties to defendants 2 to 12. Defendants 3 and\\n4 were in possession of some of the mortgaged houses built upon land belonging to the Railway, and\\ndefendants 6 to 12 were in possession of some of the remaining mortgaged property. In the mortgage\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">bond, the property mortgaged was described by their dag and patta numbers in use before the last Re-\\nsettlement. At the last Resettlement, the old numbers and pattas were given new numbers as shown\\nin  the  schedule  attached  to  the  plaint.  The  area  comprised  in  the  new  numbers  and  pattas  is  also\\nmentioned in the schedule.

What relief, if any, is the plaintiff entitled to ?\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">5. On all the issues, except Issue 1, the findings of the trial Court were in favour of the plaintiff. On\\nIssue 1, the trial Court dismissed the plaintiff\\'s suit holding that the plaintiff alone was not entitled\\nto sue.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">6.  Mr.  Sen  for  the  appellant  has  contended  that  the  plaintiff-appellant\\'s  suit  was  not  liable  to  be\\ndismissed for the reasons stated by the trial Court : assuming that the plaintiff\\'s sons are members of\\nthe joint family of which the plaintiff is the karta, the trial Court should have given an opportunity to\\nthe plaintiff to join his sons as parties to the suit. We think the contention is well founded. This was a\\nsuit by a mortgagee under the provisions of O.34, Civil P.C., for the sale of the mortgaged property.\\nThe mortgage bond was executed in favour of the plaintiff alone and he alone, therefore, was entitled\\nto bring a suit for the sale of the mortgaged property. It appears from the evidence of the plaintiff\\nthat the father of defendant 1 was a member of a Mitakshara Hindu joint family and was the karta of\\nhis family ; the family business consisted of liquor shops at Guijan and Ledo and a sundry shop at\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Guijan ; the father of defendant 1 had dealings with the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">plaintiff and, as a result of the dealings between them, the father of defendant 1 became indebted\\nto the plaintiff in the sum of Rs. 8244-3-0. It was in respect of this indebtedness that the father of\\ndefendant 1 executed the mortgage bond. It is true that this debt of Rs. 8000 odd was due to the firm\\nof Rajkumar Shah Joygovinda Shah, of which the plaintiff was a partner. After the dissolution of the\\npartnership, however, the father of defendant 1 acknowledged his liability in respect of the debt to\\nthe plaintiff and executed the mortgage bond in his favour.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">7. We think the view taken by the trial Court that the sons of the plaintiff were necessary parties to\\nthe suit, cannot be sustained in view of the observations of their Lordships of the Privy Council in\\nKishan Prasad v. Har Narain Singh, 33 ALL. 272 (9 I. C. 739). The head-note to the decision, which\\nis in conformity with their Lordships\\'- judgment, reads as follows :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"Where a joint family business has to be carried on in the interests of the joint family as a whole, the\\nmanaging members may properly be entrusted with the power of making contracts, giving receipts,\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">and compromising or discharging claims ordinarily incidental to the business ; and where they are so\\nentrusted and empowered, they are entitled as the sole managers of the family business, to make in\\ntheir own names contracts in the course of that business, and to maintain suits brought to enforce those\\ncontracts without joining in the suit with them either as plaintiffs or defendants the other members\\nof the family.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">8. There is no doubt from the facts of this case that after the dissolution of the plaintiff\\'s partnership\\nwith the firm of Rajkumar Shah, the plaintiff was carrying on a joint family business in the interests of\\nthe joint family as a whole and was competent to obtain a mortgage bond from the father of defendant\\n1 as security for the debt acknowledged by him as being due to the plaintiff alone.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">9. In a later decision of their Lordships of the Privy Council in Sheo Shankar Ram v. Mt. Jaddo\\nKunwar, 36 ALL. 383: (AIR(1) 1914 P.C. 136), their Lordships of the Privy Council affirmed the\\ndecision of the Allahabad High Court observing\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"that the plaintiffs who sued to redeem a mortgage after foreclosure on the plea that they had not been\\nparties to the mortgage suit, were properly and effectively represented in the suit by the managing\\nmembers of the Hindu joint family, of which the plaintiffs were also members, and that in such a case,\\nthe Court was not bound to set aside the execution proceedings where substantial justice had been\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">done merely because every existing member of the family was not formally a party to the suit.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Their Lordships also observed they saw no reason to dissent from the Indian decisions which showed\\nthat there were occasions, including fore. closure actions, when the managers of a Hindu joint family\\nso effectively represented all the other members that the family as a whole was bound, and were of\\nopinion that it was clear on the facts of this case; and on the findings of the Court upon them, that it\\nwas a case where that principle ought to be applied. There was not the slightest ground for suggesting\\nthat the managers of the joint family did not act in every way in the interests of the family itself and\\nno question arose u/S. 85, T. P. Act, (IV [4] of 1882), because the mortgagee had no notice of the\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">plaintiff\\'s interests.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">10. We cannot see how in the case before us the interest of the plaintiff\\'s sons are in any way affected\\nby the plaintiff alone having brought the suit for sale of the mortgaged property. It is a question of fact\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">in each case whether the karta effectively represents the other members of the joint family, and we\\ncan find nothing in the facts of this case from which it can be inferred that the father did not represent\\nthe sons. The sons have not sought to be made parties to the suit.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">11. In Lingangowda Dod-Basangowda v. Basangowda Bistangowda, AIR(14) 1927 Bom. 56: (51\\nBom, 450), their Lordships observed:\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"In the case of a Hindu family where all have rights, it is impossible to allow each member of the\\nfamily to litigate the same point over and over again, and each infant to wait till he comes of age and\\nthen bring an action, or bring an action by his guardian before; and in each of these cases, therefore,\\nthe Court looks to Expln.6 of S.11, Civil P.C., to see whether or not the leading member of the family\\nhas been acting either on behalf of minors in their interest, or if they are majors, with the assent of\\nthe majors.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">As  we  have  observed,  the  plaintiff\\'s  sons,  if  they  have  any  interest  in  the  mortgage  security,  are\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">properly represented by their father, the plaintiff.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">12. The decision of the Patna High Court in Hit Lal Mahton v. Jaboo Mahton, 3 pat. 81: (AIR (11)\\n1924 pat. 458) is directly in point. In that case, it was held:\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"Where a mortgage bond is executed in favour of two members of a joint Hindu family to secure\\nmoney advanced from joint family funds, the mortgagees named in the bond are entitled to sue to\\nenforce the bond without joining the other members of the family as parties.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Dawson Miller C, J. in delivering the judgment of the Division Bench, observed :\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">\"The mortgagors entered into the transaction with the mortgagees in the name of the latter alone,\\ntreating  them  as  the  other  contracting  party.  If,  at  the  due  date,  the  mortgagors  had  tendered  the\\nprincipal sum advanced together with any interest remaining due to the plaintiffs as mortgagees, it is\\nconceded that the latter could have given a valid acquittance binding upon the other members of the\\nfamily who were interested in the mortgage. It must be presumed that in entering into the transaction,\\nthey were authorized to do so on behalf of all the members of the family, and if they could grant a\\nvalid discharge to the mortgagors on\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">payment of the principal sum, I can see no reason why they should not be presumed to have implied\\nauthority to enforce payment by a suit. The question appears to me to be one of authority and, if they\\nwere authorised to enter into the transaction on behalf of the family, I think it must be taken that they\\nwere equally authorised to institute a suit to enforce it.\"\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">13. The Patna, Allahabad and Madras High Courts have taken the view that a mortgage suit brought\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">by or against the manager of a joint Hindu family without impleading the other members of the family,\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">does not fail on account of non-joinder. The Calcutta High Court, however, dissents from this view,\\nbut we think that, in view of the pronouncements of their Lordships of the Privy Council in the cases\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">to which we have referred, the view of the Patna, Allahabacl and Madras High Courts appears to be\\nthe better view.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">14. Mr. Barua for respondent 2 did not support the judgment and decree of the trial Court for the\\nreasons stated by it, but urged another ground for the first time before us, namely, that as the partners\\nof the dissolved firm of Rajkumar Shah Joygovind Shah have not been made parties to the suit, the\\nsuit was liable to be dismissed. We think there is no substance in this ground. It was the plaintiff\\'s\\ncase that the debt due to the firm of Rajkumar Shah, of which he was a partner, was acknowledged\\nby the father of defendant 1 as being due to him alone upon the dissolution of that firm. This was a\\nquestion of fact which should have been agitated in the trial Court. Indeed we find that the plaintiff\\nwas not even questioned on this point. It was next contended that respondent 2 being in possession\\nof the mortgaged houses which stood on the land belonging to the Railway and which the mortgagor\\nhad no right to mortgage, the houses should be regarded in law as chattels, and a suit for the sale of\\nchattels was time-barred at the date of institution of the suit. Again, this point was not raised before\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">the trial Court, and no authority has been cited to us in support of it.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">15. It was lastly contended by Mr. Barua that the provisions of the Assam Money-lenders Act apply\\nto the transaction in suit and that the decree-holder was in no case entitled to a decree for an amount\\nexceeding twice the principal amount due. As we propose to set aside the judgment and decree of\\nthe trial Court on the issue of the maintainability of the suit and remand the appeal to the trial Court\\nto enable it to pass the usual preliminary mortgage decree after notice to the advocate of the parties,\\nit will be open to Mr. Banta to raise this point before the trial Court and obtain a decision thereon,\\nbefore the preliminary decree is passed.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">16. Mr. Gupta for the respondent 12 raised only two points before us. Firstly, that respondent 12 was\\na bona fide purchaser for value without notice of the encumbrance, and secondly, that no mortgage\\ndecree could be passed in this suit because the properties mentioned in the schedule are not proved\\nto be identical with the properties mentioned in the mortgage deed.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">17.  As  to  the  first  contention,  there  is  a  finding  of  fact  of  the  trial  Court  that  respondent  12\\nhad  knowledge  of  the  encumbrance.  The  learned  Judge\\'s  finding  is  based  upon  the  evidence  of\\none  Lakshmichand  Agarwalla,  a  witness  examined  on  behalf  of  defendants  6  and  7,  from  whom\\nrespondent  12  purchased  some  of  the  mortgaged  properties.  It  is  clear  from  the  evidence  of\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Lakshmichand that he and the mortgagor went to Babu Prafulla, Chandra Bagchi, an advocate, and\\none Rajani Chakravarty, a petition-writer and sought the advice of the advocate in the matter of the\\nsale of the property in suit. The advocate asked the witness to enquire from the Registration Office\\nif there was any encumbrance, but the witness did not go to the Registration Office, nor did he make\\nany enquiry to satisfy himself in this behalf. We think the trial Court was right in saying that the case\\nof respondent 12 is no better than the case of defendants 6 and 7 who like other respondents except\\n2 and 12 have not contested the appeal.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">18. As to the identity of the mortgaged property with the property as mentioned in the schedule,\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">we do not think there is any difficulty in passing a preliminary mortgage decree involving property\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">mentioned in the mortgage bond; nor do we think there is any difficulty in passing a preliminary\\nmortgage decree merely because the mortgaged property consists of a half undivided share of the\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p><div style=\"display:flex; flex-direction:column;\"><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">property mentioned in the mortgage deed and that out of the half undivided share some portion of\\nit has been sold to respondent 12, as is contended by his advocate. If and when the property is sold\\nafter the usual preliminary mortgage decree is passed, the sale will doubtless be limited to the half\\nundivided share of the mortgaged property, and the auction. purchaser will get joint possession with\\nthe transferees of the mortgagor or those claiming under him. The question of the transferees of the\\nmortgagor or those claiming under him retaining what has been given to them under the pattas issued\\nto them by the Revenue authorities, will properly arise in a suit for partition, which may hereafter be\\ninstituted by the auction-purchaser. The question of equities in favour of the transferees arising out of\\nthe grant of pattas to them by the Revenue authorities will be a matter for decision in a partition suit.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">19. In the view we have taken, the judgment and decree of the trial Court is set aside and the appeal\\nis remanded to the trial Court to pass a usual preliminary mortgage decree after notice to respondents\\n</span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">2 and 12. As we have observed, the learned advocate for respondent 12 who has raised the question\\nof the applicability of the Assam Money-lenders Act before us, will be at liberty to agitate this point\\nbefore the trial Court, before it passes a preliminary mortgage decree. The dispute as to the identity\\nof the property will be decided by the trial Court if and when the mortgaged property is put to sale.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">20. The result is that the appeal is allowed with costs.\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\"><span style=\"font-size:13px\">Appeal Allowed .\\n</span></p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;\">\\n</p><p style=\"width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;\"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></article>']\n"
