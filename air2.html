found that the first accused was guilty and he, therefore, convicted him and sentenced him to pay a
fine of Rs. 10. In default of payment of fine, he was directed to undergo simple imprisonment for
one week.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">3. The reference is made to the High Court for the alleged reason that the first accused who is deaf
</span><span style="font-size:13px">and dumb could not be made to understand the proceedings against him. Section 281, Travancore
</span><span style="font-size:13px">Criminal P. C. under which the reference is made, is worded as follows :
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;">
</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;">

</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">"If the accused, though not insane, cannot be made to understand the proceedings, the Court may
proceed with the enquiry or trial; and if such inquiry results in a commitment, or if such trial results in
a conviction, the proceedings shall be forwarded to our High Court with a report of the circumstances
of the case, and our High Court shall pass thereon such order as it thin us fit."
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">4. To elucidate the scope of the section, the learned Public Prosecutor who appeared on behalf of the
State has invited our attention to a few relevant decisions of other High Courts under the corresponding
section of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure. In the case report in Allah Dia v. Emperor, a.I.r.
(16) 1929 Lah. 840: (29 Cr. L. J. 1104), which was decided by Shadi Lal C j., there was a reference
made to the Lahore High Court under S. 341, Indian Criminal P. C. The accused in that case was
a deaf, mute but at the trial, it was noted that he was represented by a pleader and that one of his
brothers was also invited to attend the Court. Questions were put to the accused through his brother
who knew the method of communicating with the deaf-mute and the statement of the accused was
also recorded by resorting to this method. The questions were put through the brother of the accused
</span><span style="font-size:13px">and the answers were given by the accused with signs which his brother understood and explained.
The Court recorded that the accused bad pleaded not guilty. It was held in that case that the facts did
not warrant a reference under S. 341. Such a reference could be made only if the accused, though
not insane, cannot be made to understand the proceedings. This requirement of law was absent in
that case. The records were, therefore, sent back to the Magistrate in order that he may deal with the
case in accordance with law. In the case reported in Emperor v. A deaf and dumb, A. I. r. (4) 1917
Bom. 288 : (18 Cr. L. J. 143), the proceedings in the trial Court were submitted to the High Court
under S. 341, Indian Criminal P. C. There the learned Judges of the Bombay High Court agreed with
the Magistrate in holding that the accused understood the nature of his act when he committed the
crime with which he was charged. The conviction for the offence of theft which was recorded in the
order of the trial Court was, therefore, confirmed, and the High Court passed sentence on the accused.
This case indicates that the duty of the Magistrate in cases like the present, is to record a finding of
conviction if a case is made out against the accused upon the evidence called for the prosecution.
There is no provision in the section for passing a sentence before the case is referred to the High Court
under S. 341. It is the High Court that must pass the necessary orders. In the case reported in 6 M.
H. C. R. App VII, the Magistrate before whom the trial took place of a deaf and dumb prisoner, did
not make any attempt to communicate with the prisoner. The charge against the prisoner was that he
had escaped from lawful custody. After the trial, the Magistrate recorded a finding of conviction and
</span><span style="font-size:13px">sentenced the accused to one month's rigorous imprisonment. The joint Magistrate referred the case to
the High Court and the learned Judges of the High Court held that the proceeding of the Magistrate in
conducting the trial without making any attempt to communicate with the prisoner was clearly wrong
and that the High Court was unable to say that the prisoner was not prejudiced by the irregularity. In
the circumstances, the conviction was quashed, but it was held that in the opinion of the High Court,
it was not advisable to direct a new trial. In Emperor v. Khashaba, A. I. R. (10) 1923 Bom. 194 : (25
Cr. L. J. 660), the accused was a deaf and dumb person who was convicted for attempting to commit
suicide. The conviction was mainly based upon a statement which was communicated by the accused
by signs. On examining the records and the evidence, the High Court took the view that the conviction
</span><span style="font-size:13px">was correct and directed that the accused should be sentenced to one day's simple imprisonment. In
</span><span style="font-size:13px">the case reported in In re Boya Polamma, A. I. R. (28) 1941 Mad. 225 : (42 Cr L. J. 315), up to a
certain stage of the trial before the Sessions Judge of Kurnool, the accused was able to follow the
proceedings. The charge against her was that she had committed the offence of murder. After the
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;">
</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;">
</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;">
</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">prosecution evidence was closed and the accused was asked to make a statement, she pleaded that
she was unable to hear anything. Therefore, the Judge desisted from making further questions. The
accused was represented by a Vakil appointed by the Crown who raised the defence that the case was
foisted on the accused. A confession had been duly recorded by a Magistrate before the trial in the
Sessions Court began, and the accused
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">herself had produced the jewels which she had taken, from the body of the woman she killed. In
these circumstances, the High Court held that there was no miscarriage of justice merely because the
accused became deaf towards the end of the trial when questions were being put to her by the trial
Court, The High Court accordingly confirmed the conviction and passed sentence of transportation
for life under S. 341, Indian Criminal P. C.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">5.  Apart  from  these  decisions,  it  will  be  seen  from  the  section  that  where  the  accused  cannot  be
</span><span style="font-size:13px">made to understand the proceedings against him, the trial Court can, after recording the evidence for
the prosecution, convict the accused, but the section does not provide for passing a sentence on the
accused. The proper course for the trial Court to adopt, if the trial results in a conviction, is to submit
the proceedings to the High Court for such orders as the High Court may think fit to pass, thus leaving
it to the High Court in appropriate cases to pass the sentence.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">6. We notice that no endeavour was, made in the course of the trial to communicate with the accused
through some person acquainted with the method of doing so. The accused, in spite of his physical
defect, has, according to the evidence, the capacity to look after his interests. He was cultivating his
own land. He was engaging coolies for doing so. The second accused was one of those coolies. Charge
against the first accused was that be beat the complainant with a Nattan stick. The circumstances
in which lie committed this offence of voluntarily causing hurt were as follows, according to the
judgment of the trial Court:
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">"P. w. 1 at the instance of his master cut open the bund to let in water into his master's paddy land
from the accused's paddy land. On the afternoon, a2 the servant of A 1 came to the place and saw the
bund cut open. He asked P. W. 1 who did it. The latter told him that he has done so at the instance of
his master. A2 returned and brought A 1 with him ............ P. W. 1 was then taking his meal ......... A1
</span><span style="font-size:13px">asked P. W. 1 who out open the bund. A1 demanded P. W. 1 to close the bund. He did not comply
with the demand. A1 then with a rattan stick in his hand beat P. W. 1 once on his back and voluntarily
caused hurt to him . . . . "
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">It would appear from this narrative in the judgment of the trial Court, that the first accused was capable
of understanding ideas transmitted to him and of communicating his ideas. These were evidently done
by means of gestures and signs. Moreover, D. W. 3 is the younger brother of accused 1. It was this
witness who stated, perhaps not in conformity with the whole truth, that accused 1 was deaf and dumb
and that he was incapable of looking after his family affairs. The narrative of events which culminated
</span><span style="font-size:13px">in the 'attack of P. W. 1 clearly shows that accused 1 was not incapable of attending to his business.
</span><span style="font-size:13px">No endeavour seems to have been made in the trial Court to communicate with accused 1, through
persons who are acquainted with his habits. His younger brother, P. W. 3 would have been a suitable
person for transmitting the ideas which the Court wanted to communicate to accused 1. This was not
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;">
</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:right;">
</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:center;">
</p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">done. It is incumbent upon the Court under the relevant section of the Criminal Procedure Code to
endeavour to communicate with the accused and the omission to do so is opposed to law.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">7. We notice, however, from the records that the accused had engaged a pleader to defend him and
he was defended. He had executed a vakkalath in favour of the pleader, who has also attested his
signature to the vakkalathu. But the signature is not legible. It looks more like a mark. Therefore, it
cannot be inferred that the accused is in a position to read or to write. But he has sufficient intelligence
to understand what he is doing, because the pleader took the responsibility of attesting his signature
to the vakkalath. Considering the nature of the injury inflicted by accused 1 on P. W. 1 and the other
circumstances adverted to, the conviction and sentence seem to us to be correct and in spite of the
irregularities which we have noticed, they do not call for interference by this Court. There is no reason
to direct a fresh trial, because we are satisfied that the order made by the Court below in convicting
the accused is warranted by the evidence in the case. We, therefore, see no reason to interfere and
direct these records to be returned to the trial Court.
