</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">1.  SUBBA RAO, C.J. :-This court-fee matter has been referred to a Bench by the taxing Judge.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">2. The facts are simple. The appellant obtained a decree for possession and for mesne profits in O. S.
No. 104 of 1926 on the file of the Court of the Subordinate Judge, Eluru. He filed an application,
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">I. A. No. 1014 of 1952, under O. 20, R. 12(2), Civil P. C., for ascertainment of profits subsequent
to the suit.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">The Subordinate Judge passed a decree in favour of the appellant for a sum of Rs. 1876-12-0 towards
mesne profits for the year 1943 and for the subsequent seven years at Rs. 1676-12-0 per year payable
with interest compoundable on 1st April every year. The appellant has filed the above appeal claiming
an  additional  amount  towards  mesne  profits  for  the  said  period  which  he  valued  in  a  sum  of  Rs.
44,980/- and paid a court-fee of Rs. 2/-. The office raised an objection expressing the view that an
valorem court-fee should be paid on the value of the subject-matter of the appeal.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">3. Learned counsel for the appellant contends that, in the case of mesne profits subsequent to the filing
of the suit, the procedure prescribed by S. 11, Court-fees Act should be followed and that his liability
to  pay  court-fee  would  arise  only  when  he  seeks  to  execute  the  decree,  whereas  the  Government
Pleader argues that the question of court-fee payable on a memorandum of appeal depends upon the
value of the subject-matter of the appeal and that in a case where mesne profits are ascertained, court-
fee is payable on the ascertained value of the subject-matter.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">4. It would be convenient to read the relevant provisions pertaining to suits as well as appeals visa-
vis the payment of court-fee before considering the case law on the subject.

prior to the institution of the suit. They are also designed to protect the interests of the State exchequer.
The plaintiff is enabled to value his claim for past mesne profits tentatively and to pay the difference
between the court-fee paid and payable on the amount ascertained either before the decree is made
or before the execution is ordered.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">6.  There  is  a  conflict  of  views  on  the  question  which  is  not  relevant  for  the  present  enquiry,
namely,  whether  a  Court  can  make  in  the  first  instance,  a  decree  for  future  profits.  While  in
Ramalinga Sethupathi v. Andiappan Ambalam, ILR 54 Mad) 980 : (AIR 1931 Mad 717) (A) and
</span><span style="font-size:13px">Ekanthalingaswamy Koil, In re, ILR 1937 Mad 284 : (AIR 1937 Mad 46) (B), it was held that para. 1
of S. 11 would not apply to a decree for future mesne profits, another Division Bench of the same High
Court in Veeran Chetti v. Veeran Chetti, ILR 1938 Mad 1050 : (AIR 1938 Mad 727) (C) expressed
the view that para. 1 of S. 11 applies even to a decree for future mesne profits.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Where a Court gives a decree for mesne profits without directing further enquiry under para. 1 of S.
11, the decree cannot be executed till the difference between the fee actually paid and the fee payable
shall have been paid to the proper officer. Where a decree directs an enquiry to be made as regards
past mesne profits, no decree can be made unless the difference between the court-fee actually paid
and the fee payable on the amount ascertained has been paid.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Where a decree directs an enquiry as to mesne profits from the institution of the suit under para. 3,
the final decree made cannot be executed unless the court-fee payable on the amount ascertained is
paid. These provisions, in terms as well as in substance, provide for court-fee payable in a suit for
past and future mesne profits and the stages at which they are payable. There appears to be a lacuna
in the scheme from the standpoint of the State exchequer.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">A party, who obtains a decree for future mesne profits in the first instance, or, in whose favour a
</span><span style="font-size:13px">decree for future mesne profits is made on enquiry, can evade payment of court-fee if he chooses not
to execute the decree, or, if the decree is satisfied outside the Court.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">But, that need not detain us as nothing turns upon that in the present case. We have mentioned all this
only to show that the provisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant are only
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">designed to prevent evasion of court-fee payable on the claims finally ascertained and embodied in
</span><span style="font-size:13px">a decree in a suit for mesne profits.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">7. The principles governing the payment of court-fee in the case of appeals against the said decrees
are found elsewhere. Under S. 4 Court-fees Act, no document of any of the kinds specified in the
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">first or second schedule to this Act, annexed as chargeable with fees, shall be received or furnished
by any of the High Courts in any case coming before such Court in the exercise of its extraordinary
original jurisdiction, or in the exercise of its jurisdiction as regards appeals from the judgments other
than judgments passed in the exercise of the ordinary original jurisdiction of the Court of one or more
Judges of the said Court or of a Division Court, or in the exercise of its jurisdiction as regards appeals
from the Courts subject to its superintendence, unless in respect of such document there be paid a fee
of an amount not less than that indicated by either of the said schedules as the proper fee for such
document.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Schedule I prescribes the ad valorem fee at different rates payable on the amount or value of the
subject-matter in dispute in the appeal. To fix the court-fee payable, the Court will have to ascertain
the amount or the value of the subject-matter in dispute. Doubtless, the other provisions of the Act
may enable the Court to ascertain the value of the subject-matter. The question, therefore, is what is
the value of the subject-matter of the appeal filed against a final decree ascertaining mesne profits
</span><span style="font-size:13px">due to the plaintiff.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Looking squarely at the problem uninfluenced by decided cases, we do not see any difficulty in fixing
the value of the subject-matter of the appeal in such case. In a suit for past mesne profits, the value of
the subject-matter is always approximately given, for that requires to be ascertained in the suit. The
plaintiff, therefore, puts his own valuation on the claim and pays court-fee.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">In  the  case  of  future  mesne  profits,  the  claim  is  based  upon  a  different  cause  of  action  but  for
convenience and to avoid multiplicity of suits, the Court, in its discretion, may direct an enquiry in
regard to the said profits. The preliminary decree may reject the claim for future mesne profits or may
direct an enquiry for the ascertainment of future mesne profits. At the stage when an application is
filed for enquiry, the plaintiff will not be in a position to know definitely the rate or the period for
which he will be entitled to recover the said profits.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">But when once the Court ascertains the rate and fixes the period and passes a decree for future mesne
profits, it is impossible thereafter to contend that his claim is in a fluid state. The Court has exercised
the discretion in his favour recognised his right and ascertained the amount due to him. What was
nebulous at the time when he asked for an enquiry has been crystallised. The Court gives him a decree
for a specific amount.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">If the defendant prefers an appeal questioning the decree passed against him it is not disputed that he
will have to pay ad valorem court-fee on the amount decreed as that amount is the subject-matter of
the appeal. If the plaintiff got towards his future mesne profits but seeks to get some more amount,
can it be said that the excess he claims in definite terms is not an ascertained amount? The subject-
matter of the appeal in that contingency is the excess amount which he claims in the appeal.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">To put it differently, the test is whether the mesne profits, past or future, are ascertained. If they are
ascertained, whether the defendant files an appeal seeking to escape from liability completely or in
</span><span style="font-size:13px">part, or, the plaintiff files an appeal questioning the correctness of the amount and claiming additional
</span><span style="font-size:13px">amount, in either case the subject-matter of the appeal is definite and is capable of valuation.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">At the inception of the proceedings, the rate at which future mesne profits are payable or the term for
which it is payable will not be definite. But, at the time the appeal is filed, both the rate as well as
the period have become definite and there cannot be any difficulty in evaluating the subject-matter
of the appeal.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Different  considerations  may  arise  in  a  case  where  the  Court  dismisses  an  application  for
ascertainment of mesne profits either because it refuses to exercise its discretion in favour of the
plaintiff or because it rejects his claim altogether, for, in those cases, the amount is not ascertained
and, therefore, the subject-matter of the appeal is not capable of valuation. But decisions dealing with
such situations are not of much relevance in considering a case where mesne profits are ascertained
and, therefore, the relief claimed in the appeal is capable of valuation.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">8. We shall now proceed to consider some of the cases, which throw considerable light on the question
raised. In Balarama Naidu v. Sangan Naidu, ILR 45 Mad 280 : (AIR 1923 Mad 19) (D), a Division
</span><span style="font-size:13px">Bench of the Madras High Court held that an order determining the amount of mesne profits payable,
subsequent to the filing of a suit is a final decree within O. 20, R. 12(2), Civil P. C. and ad valorem
court-fee is chargeable under Art. 1 of Sch. I, Court-fees Act calculated on the amount of mesne
profits in dispute in appeal.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">The facts there were : The appellants filed a suit against the respondent for partition of joint family
properties. A decree was passed determining the shares of both the parties. By a subsequent order,
the Court of first instance determined the amount of mesne profits subsequent to the suit at Rs. 500/-
as payable by the defendant to the plaintiff. Both parties appealed against this decision to the District
Court and each paid only 0-8-0 as court-fee on his appeal.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Ayling, Offig. C.J., and Odgers J., held that the appeals were against a final decree under O. 20, R.
12(2), Civil P. C. and ad valorem court-fee must be charged under Art, 1 of Sch. I, Court-fees Act
calculated on the amount of mesne profits in dispute. It will be seen from the aforesaid facts that the
plaintiff in his appeal claimed more mesne profits than what was awarded to him by the first Court,
while the defendant sought to get it reduced by preferring a cross-appeal.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">The  Court  held  that  court-fee  was  payable  on  the  amount  of  mesne  profits  in  dispute,  indicating
thereby that the plaintiff had to pay court-fee on the amount he had claimed in excess of what was
</span><span style="font-size:13px">awarded to him in the first Court. This is a direct decision on the question raised before us. The only
thing that can be said is that the learned Judges did not give elaborate reasons for their conclusions
but that does not detract from its authority. Apart from that we agree with the conclusion, we are also
bound by it, that being a decision of a Division Bench of the Madras High Court. .
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">9. Another Division Bench of the Madras High Court in Kandunni Nair v. Raman Nair ILR 53 Mad
540 : (AIR 1930 Mad 597) (E) held that as mesne profits were not ascertained in the preliminary
decree, no court-fee need be paid in an appeal, on the claim for mesne profits. The Subordinate Judge
had given a preliminary decree for partition which directed that the amount of mesne profits due to
</span><span style="font-size:13px">the plaintiff should be determined at the time of the passing of the final decree.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">It was held in that judgment that only three years' mesne profits were awardable but that decision was
not carried into the decree. The learned
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Judges observed at page 548 (of ILR Mad) : (at p. 599 of AIR) :
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">"The decree, which we must follow in preference to the judgment, contains no more than a direction
for the determination of the mesne profits and accordingly it is difficult to apply the terms of Sch. I,
Court-fees Act, where it is said that the fee is to be payable on the amount or value of the subject-
matter in dispute........Where, however, a preliminary decree only makes provision for the subsequent
determination of the mesne profits, we think that the apt occasion for requiring, a defendant to pay a
court-fee in this respect would be if and when the profits have been determined by a final decree."
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">10. Though in that case as the decree only contained a direction for the determination of mesne profits,
the learned Judges held that no court-fee was payable, their observations indicate that, where the
mesne profits were ascertained, if a defendant preferred an appeal, court-fee should toe paid on the
amount ascertained.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">11.  In  ILR  1937  Mad  284  :  (AIR  1937  Mad  46)  (B),  the  defendant,  against  whom  a  decree  for
possession was made preferred an appeal and the plaintiff filed a memorandum of objections putting
forward a claim for future mesne profits. The learned Judges Venkata Subba Rao, Offig. C.J., and
Horwill J., held that no court-fee was payable on the memorandum of objections. After pointing out
the procedure prescribed under S. 11, Court-fees Act, Venkata Subba Rao, Offig. C.J., posed the
question at p. 291 (of ILR Mad) : (at p. 49 of AIR) thus :
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">"Is there any reason then why in principle this rule, which applies in terms to suits, should be departed
from in the case of appeals?"
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">The learned Judge answered the question thus :
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">"True, the value of an appeal is not always the value of the suit but the value of the relief granted by
the decree which the party seeks to get rid of in that sense, where the suit and the appeal are differently
valued, the schedules to the Act may furnish the approximate articles. In the matter in hand, there is
no question of an amount being claimed in appeal in excess of what has been granted by the lower
Court. On the other hand, the claim made here is identical with that made in the Court below, namely,
</span><span style="font-size:13px">to have the right to subsequent profits adjudicated upon."
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">12. These observations, though made in a different context, recognise the distinction between a case
where the claim of the plaintiff to future mesne profits was rejected and a case where it was granted
by the Court. The observations of the learned Judge indicate the inclination of his mind to hold that,
where the defendant files an appeal against a decree for mesne profits, the value of the appeal is the
value of the relief granted by the decree and in a case where the plaintiff claims in appeal an excess
of what was granted by the lower Court, the value of the appeal is the excess claimed by him.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">13. Abdur Rahman, J., in Pulla Reddi v. Venkata Reddi, 1939-2 Mad LJ 356 : (AIR 1939 Mad 667)
</span><span style="font-size:13px">(F) held that in an appeal filed against an order dismissing an application for ascertainment of future
mesne profits the court-fee of Re. 1/- paid under Art. 2, Sch. 2, Court-fees Act was sufficient. The
judgment of the learned Judge can be sustained on the ground that the order in that case was one
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">rejecting an application for future mesne profits and not one for an ascertained amount. In a case where
the right to future mesne profits is rejected, the subject-matter of the appeal is not capable of valuation.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">14. The Patna High Court took a consistent view supporting the argument of the Government Pleader.
In Kedar Nath Goenka v. Chandra Mouleshwar Prasad, ILR 11 Pat 532 : (AIR 1932 Pat 228) (G), after
a decree for possession was made, two applications were filed by the decree-holders for ascertainment
of future mesne profits from the date of the suit up to the date of delivery of possession.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">The Subordinate Judge passed decrees for mesne profits, awarding Rs. 41,803/- and odd to one of
the decree-holders and Rs. 57,452/- and odd to another decree-holder. Four appeals were filed, two
by the decree-holders claiming additional amounts towards mesne profits and two by the judgment-
debtors questioning the decree made against them. The memorandum of appeal is each one of these
four appeals was stamped with a court-fee stamp of Rs. 4/- only.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">It was argued in that case, as it was argued before us, that ad valorem court-fee need not be paid on
</span><span style="font-size:13px">the value of the subject-matter of the appeals. The Court rejected the said contention and held that ad
valorem court-fee should be paid on the amount involved in each of the appeals. At page 536 (of ILR
Pat) : (at p. 230 of AIR), the learned Judges observed :
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">"Under  S.  4,  Court-fees  Act,  the  document  which  has  to  be  considered  is  not  the  petition  for
ascertainment of mesne profits but the memorandum of appeal......Schedule I, Art. 1, Court-fees Act
prescribes that a memorandum of appeal is to be stamped with a court-fee stamp calculated on the
amount or value of the subject-matter in dispute in the appeal. The amount or value of the subject-
matter  in  dispute  in  the  four  appeals  was  the  amount  claimed  by  the  appellant  in  each  case  and,
therefore, the memorandum of appeal in each case ought to have been stamped ad valorem."
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">We respectfully agree with the aforesaid observations :
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">15. The same High Court in Dhanukdhari Prasad v. Ramadhikari, ILR 12 Pat 188 : (AIR 1933 Pat
81) (H) held that, where the amount of mesne profits is definitely ascertained and embodied in a final
decree, and an appeal is presented against that decree, the appellant must pay on the memorandum
of appeal ad valorem court-fee calculated on the amount of the decree, which is the subject-matter
of the appeal and not merely on the value of the mesne profits claimed in the plaint. At page 194 (of
</span><span style="font-size:13px">ILR Pat) : (at pp. 83-84 of AIR), James, J., observed :
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">"The question, therefore, to be considered in the present case is that of whether ad valorem court-
fee is payable on the whole amount for which the appellants seek to avoid liability or only on that
portion of it which was included in the value of the plaint. It appears to me that the reasons given by
the Division Bench for their decision in ILR 11 Pat 532 : (AIR 1932 Pat 228) (G) should prevail, that
an appeal differs from a mere application for ascertainment of mesne profits and that a memorandum
of appeal of this kind is liable to ad valorem court-fee under Art. 1 of Sch. I, Court-fees Act.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">When  mesne  profits  have  once  been  definitely  ascertained  in  execution,  the  plaintiff  is  certainly
</span><span style="font-size:13px">capable for ascertaining the exact amount which he claims, and the defendant knows definitely the
amount of the liability which he is seeking to escape."
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"></p><div style="display:flex; flex-direction:column;"><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">16. This case also accepts the principle that, where the amount is ascertained or ascertainable, ad
valorem court-fee should be paid on the amount or the value of the subject-matter of the appeal.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">17. The same High Court again in Sheobhajan Singh v. Manik Chand Sahu, AIR 1948 Pat 103 (I)
considered the question of the court-fee payable in an appeal against an order rejecting the claim for
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">future mesne profits. There, a suit for possession and for future mesne profits of certain property was
dismissed by the trial Court but, in appeal, the claim for possession was decreed, while the relief as
to future mesne profits was refused. The defendant appealed from the decree for possession and the
plaintiff filed cross-objections on the ground that the lower appellate Court had erred in refusing the
relief as to future mesne profits.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">Meredith J. held that the claim in the cross-objection in so far as it related to a fixed period, namely,
</span><span style="font-size:13px">from the date of the institution of the suit to the date of the decree for possession, was no longer a
claim in respect of future mesne profits but was a claim in respect of antecedent mesne profits but
was a claim in respect of antecedent mesne profits and, therefore, the cross-objector must value that
claim and pay ad valorem court-fee thereon........We need not, in this case, consider the correctness
of this decision for this is contrary to the view expressed by the Madras decision.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">18.  Having  regard  to  the  provisions  of  the  Court-fees  Act  and  the  decisions  interpreting  the  said
provisions, the law may be briefly stated thus : "In a suit for mesne profits whether past or future,
if the mesne profits are ascertained and decreed, the party preferring an appeal should pay court-fee
on the amount or value of the subject-matter in the appeal. If the defendant files an appeal seeking
to get rid of the decree in whole or in part, he will have to pay court-fee in whole or in part on the
amount decreed which he seeks to vacate.
</span></p><p style="width:100%; height:fit-content; margin:6px; text-align:left;"><span style="font-size:13px">If a plaintiff seeks to file an appeal questioning the correctness of the amount ascertained and decreed
in his favour, the subject-matter of the appeal will be the excess amount he claims to have over that
already awarded to him, and, therefore, he will have to pay ad valorem court-fee on the additional
amount he claims. In either case, the mesne profits are ascertained and the party, be he a plaintiff or a
defendant, know the exact amount, which is the subject-matter of appeal." We answer the reference
</span><span style="font-size:13px">accordingly.
