What a plaintiff has to satisfy the Court about is that he is honestly wanting the land for his own use as required by the proviso.

A plaintiff may have land in possession and he may be wanting more land. He is to satisfy the Court that he wants it for his own cultivation. If he can satisfy the Court on that point  he could have as much land for his own cultivation as he can manager Similar consideration will govern where ejectment is prayed for in order to-build a homestead though so far as residential accommodation is concerned  the question may be somewhat on a different footing so far as proof goes. In order to satisfy the Court that he requires the land for building a homestead  a plaintiff may have to bring out the circumstances which go to indicate that he has reasons for acting in the manner that he proposes to do. Plaintiff may have his own reasons for preferring a particular land for his homestead. The choice lies with him.

A solemn document such as a will  must be respected by Courts of law  and it would be an act of injustice to attribute to a dead man who has created an endowment to take effect on his death  an intention to create a fictitious endowment merely because the person in whom he reposed confidence has betrayed his confidence. _:::_(B) Hindu law - Religious endowment - Manager appropriating income of endowed property - Endowment  if fictitious - Inference.

Some five months before the litigation commenced  the plaintiffs called upon the Railway Administration to make an enquiry into the matter of the loss of the consignment  and sent a reminder to the Railway Administration 3 weeks later. In the two letters  there was no specific request made by the plaintiffs for a disclosure by the Railway Administration as to the manner in which it had dealt with the consignment in transit  but it was plain from the endorsement of the Chief Commercial Manager forwarding a copy of the letter to the Station Master concerned that he understood the implication of the request made by the plaintiffs in the matter of the enquiry into the non-delivery of the consignment  However  the Railway Administration failed  before the litigation commenced  to furnish to the plaintiffs particulars of the manner in which the consignment was dealt with in transit. Even after a pleader's notice was served upon the Railway Administration  the Deputy Director  Railway Board  merely replied that the pleader's notice had been forwarded for disposal to the General Manager. No communication  however  was received by the plaintiffs from the General Manager. When the dispute came to the stage of litigation  the Railway Administration again did not lead any evidence in discharge of its obligation under the proviso contained in Risk Note B: _:::_Held (1) that there was no obligation on the plaintiffs to call upon the Railway Administration to give evidence at the trial in discharge of its obligation under the proviso contained in Risk Note B  the _:::_obligation of the Railway Administration being unconditional; _:::_(2) that the terms of cl (g) of S.114  Evidence Act  were clearly attracted  the presumption being that if the Railway Administration had produced the reports and led evidence as to the manner in which the consignment was dealt with in transit  the reports and the evidence would have gone against the Railway Administration  and given rise to an inference of misconduct on the part of the Administration or its servants. _:::_Decree Varied . ,The Governor-General of India in Council - Appellant v.

The perusal of the record of the Court below goes to show that no notice in regard to the proceedings pending was published in any newspaper. Not even the debtors of the deceased were informed of the proceedings pending. No doubt  Mt. Bhoori is cited as opposite party in the application but unless a duo publication has been made of the proceedings pending it cannot be said whether she is a bona fide person or one in collusion with the applicant. The Court below in its order writes to observe that the will should have been probated. This objection of the Court below does not appear to me to be a correct one. Sections 212 and 213  Succession Act are certainly no bar in the present case to the issue of a succession certificate. Dave Liladhar v.

The rule as to the next presumptive reversioners' consent to an alienation by a Hindu widow furnishing presumptive proof of the propriety and validity of such alienation is to be regarded merely as a rule of evidence based on considerations of prudence  and not a rule of Hindu law  based on any texts. It cannot and should not make any difference in the matter of the operation of the rule  except perhaps as regards the strength of the presumption about the validity or the propriety of the alienation  that the neat presumptive reversioner or reversioners whose consent is relied on as a defence to an action brought to impugn an alienation by a widow  is or are a male or males who  in case of his or their being the actual reversioner or reversioners at the time of the widow's death  would succeed to a full estate  or a female or females who would only succeed to a life estate. The strength of the presumption as to the validity or the propriety of the transfer must vary according to the surrounding circumstances in each case and that also regardless of the sex of the consenting reversioner. The consent of the _:::_next reversioners where it is purchased for a consideration cannot be evidence of the propriety of the transaction as against the actual reversioner. The initial onus of proving legal necessity which rests on the vendees must be deemed to have been shifted to the reversioners as soon as the former has proved that the impugned alienation had been made with the consent of the next presumptive reversioners and shall be deemed to have been effectively discharged unless the Court discovers any evidence which can be held to be sufficient to rebut the presumption arising on proof of such consent. If it otherwise appears that the alienation itself was an act of necessity  it cannot be held to be otherwise merely because actually no necessity existed for a fraction of the sale consideration: Case law discussed. _:::_K.L Gosain and H.S.

ORDER. - This is a mortgagee's application revision on the ground that be is not necessary party in a suit for pre-emption against the vendors and the vendee. It appears that the property in suit was first mortgaged by the vendors in favour of the mortgagee and was then sold by the vendors to the vendee. The plaintiffs filed a suit against the vendors and the vendee for the pre-emption of the property  and also impleaded therein the mortgagee as a party. The mortgagee put in an objection before the Court below to the effect that he was not necessary party in the suit. The Court below  however  rejected his objection  The mortgagee has now come up in revision against this order of the Court below. _:::_2. It appears from the arguments of the parties that a dispute arose before the Court below as to what _:::_was the market value of the property sought to be pre-empted for purposes of payment of Court-fees. U/S.7 (vi)  Court-fees Act read with S.7(v) of the Act  the court-fee was payable according to the value of the subject-matter. The plaintiffs' case was that the real consideration of the mortgage was only Rs.16 000. The vendee's case  on the other hand  was that the real consideration of the mortgage was Rs.20 000. It was an admitted case of both the parties that the market value of equity of redemption was Rs.2 000. No relief had been asked for in the plaint by the plaintiffs against the mortgage. The question in regard to the payment of court-fees was an incidental one. There was thus no reason as to why the mortgagee should have been considered to be a necessary party in the suit. The Court below could have easily directed the vendors and the vendee to lead evidence in the matter  if necessary. _:::_Application Allowed . ,Dolat Ram Singhi - Applicant v. S.

When a remedy was open to the applicants in a lower Court there was no reason as to why they should have come up straightway before the higher Court  If there were any special reasons that prompted the applicants not to go to lower Court first  then they should have given those reasons. It has been held time after time by different High Courts that before an application is made to the High Court for transfer of a case the District Magistrate must be moved first. The High Court would not ordinarily entertain an application for transfer when the applicant could under the law have moved the District Court for the same relief and has not done so.

A bare license without more is always revocable at the will and the pleasure of the licensor and is not assignable although S.56  Easements Act permits the assignment of a license to attend a public place of entertainment in the absence of any contrary intention. The power of revoking a bare license is not affected by the fact that the license bad been given for valuable consideration. Nor does an ""exclusive license"" differ in its incidents from an ordinary license. On the other band  if a license is coupled with a grant or interest then the grantor cannot in general revoke it so as to defeat the grant to which it is incident. Since the Judicature Act  even if the grant be defective in law e.g.  for want of a deed under seal  the license will still be regarded as irrevocable and relief will be granted by all Courts in England on equitable principles.  Further  a  bare  license  becomes  irrevocable  when  the  licensee  acting  upon  the  license  executes a work of a permanent character and incurs expense in doing so. The Indian Easements Act incorporated these principles in a somewhat restricted form. In order to be irrevocable under S.60 of that Act  the license has to be coupled with a transfer of property  whereas under the English cases it _:::_is enough if it is coupled with a grant or interest in the nature of profit.

(2) of S.25A  the words ""share"" and _:::_""portion"" are used in contradistinction with each other and the partition among the various members or groups of members in definite portions contemplated in Sub-S. (1) of S.25A appears to be a partition in which portions of the joint Hindu family property are allotted to various members or groups of members of that family. That being so  S.25A(1) requires a physical division of the property before an Income-tax Officer can pass an order that the joint Hindu family property has been partitioned amongst the various members or groups of members in definite portions. Further  when S.25A was amended the words ""that a separation has taken place"" were deleted in the amended section. The dropping out of these words in the amended Act coupled with the retention of the expression ""that the joint family property has been partitioned in definite portions"" suggests that what is contemplated is a physical partition of the joint family property and not merely a severance in interest. Also  the nature of the partition referred  as ""among the various members or groups of members""  in Sub-S.

It also means a debt not contracted as an act of reckless extravagance or wanton waste or with the intention of destroying the interests of the reversioners. It need not be one incurred for a necessary purpose  but if a non-necessary debt is unreasonably large  compared to the means and station in life of the proprietor it cannot come under the definition of a just debt. Similarly  if a number of comparatively small loans for non-necessary purposes are contracted within an unreasonably short period  they  collectively  may  amount  to  extravagance.

According to the prosecution  Man Mal  Food Inspector  took samples of milk from Tikam Chand  accused.  One  of  the  samples  was  sent  to  the  Public  Analyst  for  examination.  The  Public Analyst sent a report that  the milk was adulterated. The accused was therefore prosecuted for exposing adulterated milk for sale. The accused pleaded not guilty  and stated that  the milk in question did not belong to him but to another man called Mulls. The learned Magistrate did not accept this defence  and held that  it was the accused who was the owner of the milk. The accused was therefore convicted u/ S.13  Punjab Pure Food Act for exposing adulterated milk for sale. The accused was fined Rs.50  and was ordered to pay Rs.6 as cost of analysis. The accused filed a revision petition before the learned Sessions Judge. The learned Judge has now made this reference recommending that  the conviction of the accused should be set aside. _:::_2.

The  suit  was  decreed  in  1941.  When  Ghewar  Chand  decree-holder  proceeded  to  execute  his decree for possession  Dharam Chand raised an objection that  he had been in possession over half Nohra through one Chunni Lai. The learned Sub-Judge upheld the objection and decided that Ghewar Chand's execution petition was not maintainable. There were successive revision applications to this Court  Ultimately  this Court directed that the learned Sub-Judge should proceed to put Ghewar Chand decree-holder  in  possession  over  the  southern  half  of  the  Nohra.  Thereupon  Dharam  Chand  filed regular suit No.188 of 1948 for a declaration that he is entitled to continue in possession of the property _:::_under O.21  R.63  Civil Procedure Code. In connection with the regular suit  Dharam Chand plaintiff succeeded in inducing the trial Court to issue a temporary injunction against Ghewar Chand. Ghewar Chand appealed to the learned District Judge. The District Judge vacated the injunction granted by the trial Court. Dharam Chand moved this Court in revision. This Court by its order dated 29th October 1949 allowed the revision  and restored the order of injunction. Ghewar Chand now proposes to move the Supreme Court against this Court's order dated 29th October 1949.

The  plaintiff  applicant brought  a  suit  against  five  defendants  with  the  following  allegations.  Defendants  1  to  4  failed  to give delivery of cotton seed to defendant 5 as agreed between the parties. Consequently defendant 5 had a money claim for damages against defendants 1 to 4. This claim was assigned by defendant 5 in favour of the plaintiff. So the plaintiff brought the suit against the five defendants for damages. During the pendancy of the suit the plaintiff moved an application u/S.20 (b)  Civil Procedure Code for permission to file the suit at Ajmer. Defendants 1 to 4 are residents of Jodhpur. This application u/ S.20 (b)  Civil Procedure Code  was dismissed by the learned Sub-Judge on 10th January 1950.Hence _:::_Revision Dismissed . ,Ganga Ram - Applicant v.

There was a suit for money against the defendant on the small causes side  and was decreed ex parte against him on 17-12-1946. This is Small Cause Court Suit No. 1556 of 1946. The suit had come up for bearing previously on 7-12-1946. It appears that there was also another suit fixed for hearing on 7-12-1946. That was Small Cause Court Suit No. 539 of 1946. The 'vakalatnama' of the defendant was for some reason or the other filed in Small Cause Court Suit No. 539 of 1946 and not in Small Cause Court Suit No. 1556 of 1946. Small Cause Court Suit No. 633 of 1946 came up for hearing in due course before the Court below on 8-4-1947  when the counsel for the defendant discovered the mistake. The Court below on the discovery of the mistake transferred the 'vakalatnama' from Small Cause Court Suit No. 639 of 1916 to Small Cause Court Suit No. 1556 of 1946  and issued _:::_a notice to the plaintiff to show cause as to why the ex parte decree in his favour be not set aside in the circumstances of the case. On certain objections raised by the plaintiff an application was put in by the defendant for setting aside the ex parte decree against him on 10-7-1917. The Court below after hearing the parties rejected the defendant's application for setting aside the ex parte decree on 13-12-1948.

(d) of S.4(1)  Press (Emergency Powers) _:::_Act  shows that the offence of sedition described in the Penal Code has for its ingredients the same elements which constitute a prejudicial act within the meaning of S.34(6)  Deface of India Rules  and these ingredients are also common to the mischief envisaged by cl.(d) of S.4(1)  Press Act. In other words  if the utterance of a person is seditious it may also amount to a prejudicial act and may be taken as tending to bring into hatred or contempt or excite disaffection towards the Government. In England it has been held that in order to constitute sedition the words  etc.  must evoke such a degree of hatred or contempt or excite so much disaffection that public disorder or violence may result. The Indian law of sedition  however  is not so liberal and it has been held that incitement to violence or disorder is not an essential ingredient of the offence of sedition. The provisions of the Press Act must be interpreted liberally and in favour of the subject. The section taken and read as a whole is not to be regarded as intended to minister to the mere vanity or susceptibilities of the Government or its officers but  permit  reasonable  criticisms   comments  and  ventilation  of  grievances  although  the  same  may generate or excite some amount of resentment or disapprobation against the Government provided that such resentment or disapprobation does not generate or excite the more intense or deeper passion of hatred  contempt or disaffection. To put the same thing in another way  the hatred  contempt and _:::_disaffection made culpable by the section must  in its intensity and depth  be inure than a mere feeling of resentment or disapprobation which is generated by legitimate comments  criticisms or ventilation of genuine grievances. The explanations to S.4 clearly contemplate and indicate that one may strongly criticise without being hateful  may severely comment without being contemptuous or may openly disapprove without being disaffectionate. _:::_(Held  that none of the passages objected to amounted to anything more than reporting of news or permissible criticism of Governmental policy.) _:::_(B)Press  (Emergency  Powers)  Act  (23  of  1931)   S.4(1)(d)   S.4(1)(h)  -  Falsity  of  news  is  not sufficient to bring it within mischief of Cl.(d) - Reference to past history  though unnecessary does not fall within mischief of either Cl.(d) or Cl.(h). _:::_Petition Allowed . ,In the Matter of the Newspaper 'The Daily Pratap' an Urdu Daily of New Delhi,In the Matter of the Newspaper 'The Daily Pratap' an Urdu Daily of New Delhi,petitioner,NIL,respondent,"['ACHHRU RAM , J.', 'KAPUR , J.']",EAST PUNJAB HIGH COURT,1949-07-04,Petition Allowed,upheld

The first point raised on behalf of the landlord is that the trial Ct should have taken into consideration the improvements and structural alterations made in the premises in dispute u/S. 4 (2) of the Act. The contention to the effect  in my opinion  carries no weight for what appears to have been done were normal repairs and no improvements or structual alterations. This is also the finding of the trial Ct. No doubt  the trial Ct in its judgment writes to observe that '......the electric fittings which were installed in 1940......' the perusal of the evidence of Champalal (P. W. 2) goes to show that what was installed in 1940 was not the electric-fitting but the electric sub-meter.

ORDER. -This was a rule directed against an order passed by a learned Magistrate of Karnal whereby he convicted Harbilas  petitioner  for an offence under S.161  Penal Code  and sentenced him to rigorous imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs.200. The petitioner went up in appeal to the Sessions Judge  Karnal  who upheld the conviction and the sentence. Against this order the petitioner has come up in revision to this Court and a rule was issued by my learned brother Falshaw  J. _:::_2. The facts of the case are that the petitioner was at one time an unpaid candidate in the office of the Deputy Commissioner  Karnal. The alleged offence is of 23rd July 1948 on which date he was not an unpaid candidate as he was before. It is stated by Raj Kishen  Arms Clerk  _:::_C.W.2that  he  was  allowed  to  work  in  the  office  by  him  for  the  purpose  of  assisting  him  (Raj Kishen).According to the statement of Arjun Das P.W.5  the petitioner used to make entries in the office registers but then he was asked by this witness that he should not work in that branch (the Arms Clerks Branch) without the approval of the Superintendent of the Deputy Commissioner's office. But the witness was a clerk from 1st May 1948 to 21st June 1948 and  therefore  his evidence as far as the petitioner is concerned  does not seem to be of much relevance. From this it is not possible to say as to what exactly was the capacity in which the petitioner was working in the Deputy Commissioner's office if be was working there at all. _:::_Conviction Set Aside . ,Harbilas Convict-Petitioner v.

He is obviously wrong in this for  admittedly the premises in dispute had been rented to him nominally at a concessional rent for certain very special reasons.

This is an applt's appln for review of the judgment of my predecessor- in-Office  dated 6-5-1950  in Civil S. A. No. 115 of 1946. The perusal of the record of that case shows that my predecessor-in-office dismissed the appeal only on the ground that the representative suit that he had brought had not been brought on behalf of all the 'khewatdars' of Thok Maliyan  Ajmer  and had been brought just on behalf of all the members of the Shamlat Committee. The plaint on the record of the trial Ct goes to show that the representative suit had originally been brought on behalf of all the members of the Shamlat Committee. The appln  dated 8-7-1940  filed by the trial Ct goes to show that an amendment of the plaint had been asked for under O. 6  R. 17  C. P. C. The appln to the effect was to amend the plaint so as to sue on behalf of all the khewatdars of Thok Maliyan as well. The appln for amendment was allowed after fully hearing the parties by the trial Ct on 24-2-1941.

The trial Ct assessed the total basic rent of all the shops in dispute at Rs. 70/- per month and the standard rent at Rs. 96/4/- p.m.  and after inspection of the site apportioned the standard rent amongst the different tenants as below : (1) Tuljaram - Rs. 14/- p.m. (2) Rewachand - Rs. 60/4/-p.m. (3) Shewakram - Rs. 16/- p.m. (4) Radhakishen (not chosen to come up in revision.) - Rs. 6/- p.m. _:::_2. The main contention on behalf of the tenants  who have chosen to come up in revn  is that the basic rent determined should have been not only for the shops but also for the residential area.

The case of the prosecution was that he had in his possession thirty 12-bore and five .38- bore unlicensed cartridges. The main contention of the accused-applicant before the Court is that the  prosecution  have  altogether  failed  to  show  that  the  alleged  recovery  had  been  made  from  his possession. The contention  in my opinion  is not altogether without weight and is supported to a considerable extent by the very evidence produced on behalf of the prosecution before the trial Court. _:::_3. The house from wherein the recovery is said to have been made  is admittedly occupied by the accused-applicant  and  his  two  brothers.

The premises in suit consist of the lower flat of the house called ""Ferns Hollow""  the plaintiff alleging that she had taken steps to evict the previous tenants of the two flats which constitute the house as she required for her own use and occupation  but she had allowed the defendant to occupy the lower flat in November 1943 as a friendly act and on the understanding that it was to be vacated by the end of December 1943. Once in occupation  however  the defendant had refused to surrender possession and the suit was instituted in February 1948 and damages were claimed at double the normal rent of the flat in suit plus certain extra items of compensation. The defendant alleged that she entered into occupation of the flat as an ordinary tenant _:::_and only admitted that a sum of Rs. 727 was due. This figure was arrived at by deducting from the ordinary rent of the premises certain sums amounting to Rs. 1 494 which the defendant claimed to be entitled to deduct on account of damages on various accounts. Rupees 224 was said to be due as the sum on account of the expenditure incurred by the defendant in carrying out normal repairs  and the other amounts of Rs. 540  Rs. 280 and Re. 500 were alleged to be due as damages for being deprived of the use of the servants' quarters from June 1946 to November 1946  damages on account _:::_Revision Dismissed .

The deft. pleaded that the khata entry had been obtained by coercion and that in any case the agreement to pay the sum claimed was unenforceable as the original contract from which the original liability arose had become impossible of performance by reason of an order of the Govt. placing restrictions On the storage and supply of Bajra.

The only question that arises for determination is whether the agreement _:::_in suit is void and as such unenforceable.

His  case  was  that  the  husband  of  the  applicant  had borrowed a sum of Rs.1523-9-6  that the husband was dead and that he intended to file a civil suit for recovery of the sum and put in an application for attachment of the gold that the husband of the applicant had left in deposit with the Hind Bank. The applicant gave him to understand that he need not worry as she intended to hand over the gold after she recovered it from the Bank. He accordingly did not file the intended suit. The applicant subsequently recovered the gold but did not pay him the amount due from her and concealed the gold. The case  as such  of the opposite party was that the applicant committed an offence punishable u/S.417  Penal Code  in thus putting him off from filing the civil suit and committed an offence punishable u/S.424  Penal Code  in thus concealing the gold. _:::_The Magistrate after recording the statement of the opposite party u/S.200  Criminal Procedure Code  allowed the case to proceed on.

The tenant opposite-party is absent  and the case has proceeded ex parte as against him. The dispute is in respect of the standard rent of the premises in dispute as fixed by the trial Court as against the tenant. The case of the landlords is that the tenant has vacated the premises in dispute and is no longer interested in the standard rent as fixed by the trial Court. In view thereof  it would be unfair to analyse the order of the trial Court and see whether any increase in the standard rent as fixed by the trial Court is called for or not. It would suffice if the application in revision is struck off with the remarks that the standard rent of the premises in dispute as fixed by the trial Court as against the tenant would not be binding on the next tenant and the land lords and that  in case of a dispute  a fresh application in the matter could be filed. _:::_3.

ANSARI  J.:-The judgment debtors and the decree holders have filed separate appeals against a decision of the execution Court  by which the execution application dated 31st Thir  1353 Fasli (5th June 1944 A.D.) has been held to be partly time-barred. By the application the decree-holders prayed _:::_to execute two yearly decretal installments for 1352 F. and 1353 F.  together with interest due on four earlier pai D/- p installments  in all amounting to Rs 4905 8-0. This sum forms part of the decretal amount of Rs.30000 that was decreed on 16th Azur 1345 F. (22nd october 1935). The decree says that the entire decretal amount should be paid in fifteen yearly installments of Rs.2000 each  and in case of default in payment of any three installments  execution proceedings for the full amount then due can be taken. It is an admitted fact that a previous execution application for the entire decretal amount then due was presented  but it was dismissed on being partly satisfied on 27th isfandar 1349 F.(30th January 1940 A.D ).

The right to dispose of the share and the right to receive dividend  if any  or to participate in the surplus in the case of winding up that have been left to the share-holder cannot be said to be illusory or practically valueless  because the right to control the management by directors elected by him  the right to pass resolutions giving directions to the directors and the right to present a winding up petition have  for the time being  been suspended. The rights still possessed by the share-holder are the most important of the rights constituting his ""property""  although certain privileges incidental to the ownership have been put in abeyance for the time being. It is impossible to say that the Act has deprived the shareholder of his ""property "" in the sense in which that word is used in Arts. l9 (1) (f) and 31. The curtailment of the incidental privileges  namely the right to elect directors  to pass resolutions and to apply for winding up may well be supported as a reasonable restraint on the exercise and enjoyment of the share-holder's right of property imposed in the interests of the general public under Art. 19 (5)  namely  to secure the supply of an essential commodity and to prevent unemployment. _:::_(Per Kania C.J.

Within three years from this dismissal a third application was filed but the Court held that it was barred under S.262  Hyderabad Civil P.C.  and that the decisions in the earlier applications did not operate as res judicata: _:::_Held  that the order directing attachment in the first execution passed under S.23 (1)  Hyderabad Civil P.C.  corresponding to O.21  R.23 (1)  Civil P.C (1908) on failure of the judgment-debtor to appear operated as res judicata even though the application was eventually dismissed for default: _:::_Held further  that the order directing attachment of properties after overruling the objection of the _:::_judgment-debtor to the second execution application also operated as res judicata and precluded the judgment-debtor from raising the bar under S. 262  Hyderabad Civil P.

Order 20 bears the title ""judgment and decree"" and is devoted to the form in which judgments should be delivered and decrees passed in particular cases. The forms are not exhaustive  and R.13 itself enables the Court to give any directions that it thinks fit. ""Administration"" means management and disposal of an estate  whether it be that of a deceased person or of any other person. The power to entertain an administration suit is given not by O.20  R.13  but by S.9 of the Code and if a suit for the administration of an estate is not barred expressly or impliedly by any provision of law  it must be entertained.

D/- 2 - 12 - 1949 _:::_Muhammad Fazal Shah - Appellant v. Muhammad Asghar and anothe Respondents _:::_Criminal P.C. (5 of 1898)  S.561A - Judgment - Disparaging remarks in - Remarks about public servant - Expunging of  from record - Limits within which such remarks may be made stated - Desirability of not making such remarks about lower Courts in appellate judgments stressed. _:::_Disparaging remarks in a judgment  whether they amount to a verdict or not  imputing crime  moral delinquency or improper conduct to a person are a constant source of uneasiness and irritation to him. _:::_They lower him in the public estimation and haunt him like a spectre for life invariably visiting him whenever he enters the precincts of a Court of Justice as a witness or a party. Being fraught with such serious consequences they should only be made where any hesitation or reluctance in making them would impede the ends of justice. Persons making or publishing such remarks  whether true or not  are not liable for libel or for defamation because in the former case they are protected by common law and in the latter by statute  the reason being that unless Judges had the power to make bold and fearless comments on the evidence given before them they would not be able effectively to discharge their functions. These two conflicting considerations must always be present to the mind of a Judge whenever he is called upon to criticise the character and conduct of a person. On the one hand  he should weigh the gravity of the damage that his remarks would cause to the person concerned and on the other he must realise that he owes a duty to the parties  the public and the appellate Court of stating in full his reasons for the view he takes of the evidence. It is against a rule  as ancient as the law itself and based on common sense and fair play  that when a Judge decides to condemn a man  whether a party or witness  the facts on which condemnation is intended to be based must be put to him so as to give him an opportunity to explain the condemnatory facts and thus to remove the Judge's suspicion about his conduct. A Judge who condemns a man unheard acts as unfairly as if he were to convict a man without hearing him tin his defence. Persons who are attributed ignominious or improper conduct in judicial determinations  though they were neither parties nor witnesses in the _:::_cause  have  therefore  a just cause for complaint against this unfair treatment and such offending remarks should be expunged. The need for caution in making such remarks is'much greater where the person disparaged is a public servant acting in his own independent sphere. In such cases it is absolutely necessary that the Judge's suspicion about his conduct be communicated to him and an opportunity given to him to show cause against the view that the Judge is inclined to take of his conduct. If the officer concerned has not at all appeared before the Judge and has had no opportunity to vindicate himself  the Judge acts most unfairly  if not actually without jurisdiction  in commenting adversely on his conduct. And a Judge who makes his position in Court a mere pretext to condemn _:::_another person for personal reasons does not act as Judge at all; he is a mere party who has arrogated _:::_to himself the position of a Judge. _:::_Deletion Ordered . ,Muhammad Fazal Shah - Appellant v.

The two men then grappled with each other and were separated by some persons who arrived at the scene and took them to the police station. The accused Amir Shah was sent up for trial on charges under S.393 and S.397  Penal Code  i.e.  for attempting to commit _:::_robbery and for using a deadly weapon or attempting to cause death at the time of committing robbery. The trial Court came to the finding that no robbery had been committed and S.397 had no application. As regards S.393  Penal Code  the Court observed that the motive behind the pointing of a loaded revolver at the complainant was not clear. In the absence of any act done by the accused towards the commission of robbery  other than the pointing of the revolver at the complainant  it could not be held that he attempted to commit robbery. But the pointing of the revolver at the complainant by the accused  with his finger on the trigger  was held by the Court to amount to an offence under S.307 Penal Code.

The judgment  however  did not mention  as required by S. 368  Criminal P.C.  that the accused 'be hanged by the neck till he is dead'. The accused appealed to the High Court and the death sentence was sent up for confirmation to the High Court. The appeal was dismissed and the sentence of death was confirmed. The Advocate-General applied to the High Court under S.369  Criminal P.C.  that the 'clerical omission' be supplied : _:::_Held  that it was the duty of the Sessions Judge in the case of a sentence of death to direct that ""he be hanged by the neck till he is dead"". On appeal under S.923  Criminal P.C.  the duty of the appellate Court was  after hearing the accused and the Public Prosecutor  to decline to interfere if there was no sufficient ground and to dismiss the appeal. The appellate Court was under no obligation to define the mode in which the sentence was to be executed. That was the function of the trial Court. The judgment of the High Court  therefore  was not deficient in any respect. The confirmation by the High Court under S.376  Criminal P.C.  would mean only this : that the death sentence awarded by the trial Court was  in the view of the High Court  an appropriate sentence and should be allowed to stand. In confirming the sentence of death  it is nowhere prescribed that the High Court should clearly state that the sentence is to be executed by hanging as prescribed in the Code. The ""clerical error""  if any  was that of the Sessions Judge who failed to direct that the sentence was to be carried out by hanging _:::_by the neck. The High Court could only correct. its own error and not that of any other subordinate Court. There was thus no omission on the part of the High Court which could be made up. It was also doubtful whether the correction which was required to be made would be a mere 'clerical error'.

Order.:-This  is  a  case  reported  by  the  Additional  Sessions  Judge   Rawalpindi   with  the recommendation that the order of acquittal be set aside and a retrial ordered. _:::_2.  On  15-07-1947  Muhammad  Sarwar's  house  was  broken  into  and  some  articles  consisting  of ornaments  clothes and utensils stolen. Subsequently  some of these articles  namely  a pillow cover  a metal plate and some clothes  are alleged to have been recovered from the possession of Khuda Bakhsh. Accordingly  Khuda Bakhsh was accused of offences under S.457 and S.411  Penal Code  before Mr. A.M. Sheikh  Magistrate  1st Class  Rawalpindi. Giving evidence in the Court of that Magistrate  Muhammad Sarwar stated in detail the story of the theft  his making the first information report  the recovery of articles from the house of Khuda Bakhsh and his having identified the property so recovered. At the end of his statement  however  Muhammad Sarwar is recorded to have said that he himself had given the pillow-cover  the plate and the other clothes to the police. After the statements of some more witnesses were recorded  Mr. Sheikh was succeeded by Mr. Abdul Hamid Khan Niazi  _:::_who recorded the remaining evidence and acquitted Khuda Bakhsh on the ground that the articles were not proved to have been recovered from the possession of the accused because  according to the complainant's own statement  he himself had produced these articles before the police. Against this order of acquittal Muhammad Sarwar made a petition to the Sessions Judge  in which he denied having made before Mr. Sheikh the statement that he himself had produced before the police the articles that were alleged to have been recovered from the possession of the accused. He further alleged that his statement on which reliance was placed by Mr. Abdul Hamid Khan Niazi  had not been recorded by or in the presence of Mr. Sheikh but by his Reader in Mr. Sheikh's absence.

Act  contemplates that the person against whom the suit is brought is a total stranger who got into possession of the property after the death of the female and not to the case where some of the co-heirs get into possession after the death of the female  as their possession is presumed to be on behalf of all. _:::_Anno. Lim. Act  Art. 141  N. 2  12. _:::_(B)Limitation Act (9 of 1908)  Art.144 - Coheirs - Nature of possession-Suit by one to recover possession-Article applies. _:::_When a Mohammadan owner dies leaving several heirs they all become co-owners and tenants-in- commou.  A  joint  owner  is  legally  entitled  to  retain  possession  of  joint  property.  Even  if  he  is  in exclusive possession of such joint property  his possession is ordinarily  to be referred to his legal title. The presumption therefore is that his possession is lawful and therefore on behalf of all the co-owners. The other co-owners are accordingly in constructive possession of the property. As distinct shares have devolved on them  they all are presumed to have taken their legal shares although possession still remains joint. If therefore the co-owner in actual possession dispossesses any one of the other co-owners  the suit that is brought for recovery of possession is not a suit for a distributive share of the property of an intestate  but is a suit to recover possession of the defined  though undivided  share of the co-owner in the possession of the other co-owners. Such a suit falls under the general Art. 144  Limitation Act  limitation running from the date when the defendant's possession became adverse  A.I.R. (15) 1928 All. 467  Rel. on. _:::_Anno. Lim.

ORDER :-The accused has been convicted by the Chief Presidency Magistrate under S. 4(1)(a)  Madras Prohibition Act and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs. 50. _:::_2. The accused is a carpenter and in his carpentry shop a jar containing two gallons of varnish was found. This varnish contains denatured spirit and therefore it comes within the definition of liquor in the Act. The lower Court finds that the liquid is not drinkable and is not fit for consumption. The question is whether the accused is guilty of an offence under S. 4(1)(a) of the Act. The object of the Act as the preamble shows  is to prohibit the consumption of intoxicating liquor. It is not suggested that the varnish is intended for drink or can be used for intoxicating purposes. Being a carpenter  the possession of varnish was for a legitimate use. P.W. 1  the Prohibition Officer  says that if it is varnish he would not have seized it. The finding of the lower Court is that it is varnish. The Government have no doubt not exempted this from the purview of the Act. But the learned Crown Prosecutor  under _:::_instructions from Government states that it is not the intention of the Government that there should be a prosecution in a case like this.

So the lower Court is not proved to have erred in law in refusing a stay  as the petitioner would not be a tenant under Act XVII [17] of 1946. The learned counsel for the petitioner relies on the ruling of Subba Rao J. in Unnoli v. Subramania  (1949) 1 M. L. J. 527; (AIR (36) 1949 Mad 832). There also  the usufructuary mortgagee was held to be a tenant as he was an ""intermediary"" and so got in under that category. The petitioner here is a mere usufructuary mortgagee or panayamdar in possession as in the case in Kunhamu v. Raman Nambissan  in C. R. P.

Manavala Chowdry - for Petitioner. V. Devarajan - for Respondent. _:::_Judgement _:::_1.  ORDER :-The Municipal Council  Bezwada  which was the defendant in the suit is the petitioner. The plaintiff owned a house within the Municipal limits of Bezwada. For the two half years included in the financial year 1943-44 the Municipal Council demanded from the plaintiff tax on the building at the rate of Rs. 105-12-11 per half year. Apparently this demand was made on the ground that the building would fetch a rent of Rs. 90 per mensem. According to the plaintiff  during that period  the house was fetching only Rs. 50 per month and on this basis he was liable to be charged only Rs. 61-10-6. The Municipal Council took coercive steps and collected tax at the higher rate. The plaintiff  therefore  sued - S. C. No. 584 of 1947 on the file of the District Munsif of Bezwada - to _:::_recover the difference from the Municipal Council. The Council took the objection that the suit was not maintainable by virtue of S. 354  District Municipalities Act. This objection was overruled by the learned District Munsif who gave a decree in favour of the plaintiff. This civil revision petition is filed to vacate that decree. It appears to me that the decision of the Court below is wrong. The District Municipalities Act contains a complete get of provisions for determining the assessment payable in respect of a particular building. Section 82 lays down some of the principles on which property tax shall be assessed. Section 83 enumerates the classes of buildings which are exempt from the property tax under the Act. Section 84 requires that the tax shall be on a uniform basis. Section 85 makes the property tax a first charge on the property. Section 86 specifies when the tax shall be payable. _:::_Revision Allowed . ,"The Municipal Council, Vijayawada Petitioner v.

Criminal P.C. (5 of 1898)  S.403 - _:::_Neglect to maintain one's wife and children is not an offence within the meaning of S.4(o) of the Code. A finding of a Magistrate ordering a person to pay a certain amount of money for the maintenance of his wife and children does not amount to a conviction for an offence. The object of the proceedings _:::_under S.488 is to secure maintenance for a woman and her children speedily and to secure that end the machinery is provided in Chap. XXXVI of the Code. Even though in recording evidence procedure for summons cases may be adopted that fact alone will not convert the proceedings under S.488 into summons cases. In proceedings under S.488  the Magistrate is competent to hear the case ex parte and allow or disallow maintenance. It is thus clear that the default in maintaining the wife and children is not regarded as an offence as defined in S.4(o) of the Code.

The learned Public Prosecutor cannot say why the principle of ""autrefois acquit"" should not be applied here and the petitioner acquitted. This is not like a continuing trespass  a fresh offence every day. Though the old section (S. 15  Madras General Sales Tax Act of 1939) prescribed an added penalty of Rs. 60 a day  for continued breach  over the maximum fine of Rs. 1000 for a breach  even  that section did not say that a new prosecution can be launched every clay and that a fresh fine upto Rs. 1000 and a penalty of Rs. 50 per day for every day of non-payment after the due date can be imposed. The new section [as amended by Madras Act XXV [26] of 1947] does not contain that provision at all.

It is true that S.17 of the Act provides that any offence under S.307  S.324  S.325 or S.326  Penal Code shall not  except in cases in respect of which a direction under S.21 has been issued  cease to be triable by any Court which might have tried the offence had it not been made punishable with the enhanced penalty specified in S.16  but this provision cannot apply to Courts of Session for the obvious reason that those Courts are empowered to try offences which are punishable with death. The provision must  apply to the Courts of S.30- Magistrates who are empowered to try in certain areas all offences not punishable with death. This view is reinforced by the proviso to S.17  Central Provinces and Berar Public Safety Act  1948  which inhibits a Court not constituted under it from inflicting a punishment in excess of the punishment which it is authorised to Inflict under S.32  S.33 or S.34  Criminal Procedure Code A trial by Jury of an offence under S.307  Penal Code by a Sessions Judge  is therefore  not valid. _:::_(B)Criminal P.C.

The tenant made a deposit of the rent on 6th January 1947  that is more than two months after the commencement of the Act. He applied for stay of trial of the suit under the said Act.

RAJAMANNAR  C.J. :-The petitioner is admittedly the owner of a non-residential building in China Bazar Road  and the respondent is his tenant.

The respondent inter alia contended that the petitioner was in occupation of a building in _:::_Neelkanta Mehta Street  Thayagarayanagar  where he was carrying on his business; and therefore he was not entitled to the relief he sought. The Second Additional Rent Controller  on the evidence found that the petitioner was in occupation of a portion of a residential house in Thayagarayanagar  and that he bona fide required the premises for his own business. He found  therefore  that the petitioner was not occupying a non-residential building for the purpose of the business which he was carrying on  and in accordance with S. 7(3)(a)(ii) of Madras Act XV [15] of 1946 he directed the respondent to put the petitioner in possession of the premises.

The  only  ground  for  his  decision  which  appears  from  his  order  is  that  it  was  clear  from  the petition itself that the petitioner was doing his diamond business in No. 32 Neelkanta Mehta Street  Thayagarayanagar  and though it was a rented building  he was entitled to maintain his possession of _:::_Rule Made Absolute . ,Kota Ananda Krishna Chetty Petitioner v.

This  is  fundamental  requisite  essential  to  give  jurisdiction  to  the  detaining  authority  to  act.  It  is the satisfaction of the detaining authority that matters. It is a personal or ""subjective"" and not an impersonal or ""objective"" standard of satisfaction. The Court cannot examine the conscience' of the detaining authority to find out whether us reasons for satisfaction were sufficient. No outside decision is involved in this matter of satisfaction which rests _:::_solely with the detaining authority. The detaining authority can act on hearsay evidence and is not bound to derive its satisfaction from legal evidence. The information on which it acts is likely to be of a confidential character which need not be communicated to the detenu or disclosed in Court. If the detaining authority has acted in good faith and has come to a decision on relevant materials placed before it that detention is necessary  the Court cannot enquire into the sufficiency of the materials or reasonableness of its satisfaction in regard to the matters of which it is required to be satisfied. It is open  however  to the detenu if he can  to establish that the detaining authority has not exercised its mind on the materials placed before it and has not satisfied itself about the necessity for the detention _:::_Order Accordingly .

Narayan Govind Kale Defendant - Respondent _:::_(B)Transfer of Property Act (4 of 1882)  S.100 - Charge and mortgage - Distinction. _:::_A charge must be distinguished from a mortgage as defined in the Act  more specially from a simple mortgage. In every mortgage there must be a transfer of an interest in specific immoveable property  while in the case of a mere charge  no interest is transferred nor is it necessary that the property to which it relates should be specific. A charge differs from a mortgage not only in form but in substance. A plea of purchase for value without notice  for instance  although it may be per fectly good against a charge will be wholly unavailing against a mortgage. _:::_(D)Transfer of Property Act (4 of 1882)  S.100 - Expressions 'act of parties' and 'operation of law' - Meaning of - Charge created by decree - Doctrine of notice applies. _:::_The phrases 'act of party' and `operation of law' must be read as exhaustive of all ways in which rights of parties can be affected. An act of party is nothing more than an expression of the will or intention of the party concerned  directed to the creation  transfer or extinction of a right and effective for that purpose. An act of law  in opposition to this  means the creation  transfer or extinction of a right by operation of the law itself  independent of any consent thereto on the part of the person concerned or affected. It is an event happening otherwise than by act of party. After all  'law' has been defined as the commands of him or them that have coercive power ' and in this generic sense an order of Court is 'law' between the parties  and the resulting relations of the parties are governed by law  and not by treaty _:::_between them. This being so  it cannot be said that decrees are outside the pale of law or operation of law  and the doctrine of notice would normally apply to decrees or orders creating charges. _:::_Where  therefore  after passing of a money decree  the parties entered into an agreement whereby the decretal amount was made charge on certain immovable property of the judgment-debtor and the Court certified the adjustment by its order  it was held that the charge created by the order of the Court was one within S.100  Transfer of Property Act and was not binding on a bona fide purchaser without notice of it. The same result would follow even if the charge was not regarded as one created by decree. The order recording the adjustment could not be regarded as more than a declaratory order following a compromise between the parties. The agreement itself made the charge as one by act of parties and its subsequent incorporation in an order had no significance: AIR (31) 1944 Nag. 1  Foll.; Case law discussed. _:::_Appeal Dismissed . ,Bapurao Dajiba Plaintiff - Appellants v.

The  defendant _:::_also  undertook  to  inform  the  plaintiffs  of  the  wagon  requirements  and  bound  himself  to  load  the wagons made available by the railway authorities in the prescribed time.

In a suit by  the  plaintiffs  against  the  defendant   plaintiffs  claimed  Rs.1 30 705-0-3  and  Rs.1 41 042-7-2  as overpayments on the two accounts  Rs.50 000 as loss suffered on account of defendant's failure to maintain the machinery in good condition and Rs.10 004-8-0 as demurrage which the plaintiffs had to pay on the defendant's failure to load wagons in the prescribed time. The plaintiffs claimed an aggregate sum of Rupees 3 26 751-15-5 which was made up of the above four items and paid court- feeston this amount. The question was whether S.17(1) applied and what was the maximum court- fee payable: _:::_Held  (1)  that  the  relief  for  the  first  two  items  totalling  Rs.2 71 747-7.5  claimed  on  account  of overpayments  was  quite  distinct  and  had  nothing  whatsoever  to  do  with  the  relief  for  Rs.50 000 claimed because of the breach of one term of the contract and the relief for Rs.10 001-8 0 which was claimed for breach of another term of the contract.

Defendant 1  the father and his three sons  defendants 2 to 4 are mortgagors of certain properties _:::_mortgaged in favour of the plaintiff.

P-4 whereby defendant 1 had agreed to discharge the encumbrance existing on the property. But he did not do so; on the other hand  he acknowledged the mortgage debt without paying the same. The suit filed on 17th August 1943 was opposed by defendant 5 and the principal contest in the appeal is by defendant 5 though defendant l is also an appellant.

From the use of the word ""wholly"" it must be inferred that if the seat of control and management is in more than one place at least one of which is in British India  then the control and management of the affairs of the undivided family would not be wholly without British India  and the undivided family must be treated as resident in British India within the meaning of the section. It is not every casual act of management or looking after in British India of a  matter relating to the family that would locate the control and management of the undivided family in British India. Management implies continuous looking after an affair of the family  not an occasional looking after the affair of the family. It implies some degree of permanence and the presence of the manager is British India so as to make it practically a seat of the control or management of the affairs of the undivided family into British India. Stray acts or occasional visits for something connected with the property of the family would not by reason of the presence of the manager in connection with such matters in British India bring the control and management into British India.

Evidence Act (1 of 1872)  S.101  S.103 - _:::_The effect of the proviso to cl.(c) of S.53 is that if the condition of reconveyance is not embodied in the document which effects or purports to effect a sale  the transaction cannot be regarded as a mortgage by conditional sale. As the proviso is in a negative form it does not follow that whenever there is a condition of reconveyance in a deed of sale the transaction must be deemed to be a mortgage. This  however  does not mean that when the question arises whether a transaction is a sale or a mortgage  form is to be preferred to substance. It is an inviolable rule that upon such a question the Court must find the substance behind the form. But the onus must lie upon the person who wants to construe a document contrary to its tenor to establish the circumstances which go to prove that the sale evidenced by the document is only ostensible and not real. The Court cannot be oblivious of the fact that it is open to parties to enter into a transaction of sale with a covenant for reconveyance: AIR (27) 1940 Nag. 84  S.A.No. 421 of 1944 (Nag.) and S.A.No. 17 of 1942 (Nag.)

He admittedly signed an acknowledgment in an account book of the plaintiffs on 1st April 1945 showing that Rs. 54-3-6 was due on previous dealings. The point raised is a technical one  that this acknowledgment requires a one anna stamp under Sch.

The  learned  District  Munsif  has  referred  to  some  authorities  and  in  my  view  rightly  held  that _:::_this signature was not an acknowledgment requiring any stamp.

The judgment-debtors then filed an application under O. 21  R. 90 to have the sale set aside on various grounds  and impleaded only one of the joint bidders. The Court dismissed the application on the ground that only one of the joint bidders had been impleaded. _:::_2. Mr. Kameswara Rao for the respondent agrees with the learned counsel for the appellants that the order of the learned District Judge cannot be sustained on that ground. The proviso to O. 21  R. 92(2) is to the effect that no order setting aside a sale shall be made unless notice of the application has been given to all persons affected thereby. It would follow from this that in a proper case a sale can he set aside it notice goes to all the persons affected  and that it is unnecessary under this proviso that all the persons affected should be formally impleaded.

ORDER :In the peculiar circumstances of the case  I am of opinion that the confiscation of the jaggery  which belonged to this petitioner  for the offence committed by the lorry drives whom he had engaged to transport it and who transported it at night time against the rules was not justified  as contended by Mr. V. Rajagopalachari  advocate for the petitioner  since it was not proved that the offence of transporting the jaggery during the night was committed by the lorry driver with the knowledge or _:::_or criminal negligence of the petitioner. There is a presumption of innocence under the law  and no man shall suffer in person or property normally unless he is proved to have had the necessary mens rea. Mere suspicion of knowledge or connivance or criminal negligence will not do even for confiscation. Nor will the act of a servant or agent or carrier do. Suppose a carrier of a gun of another was convicted under S. 19  Arms Act  the gun should not normally be confiscated unless  of course  the offence has been committed with the knowledge or connivance or criminal negligence of the owner.

The levy is stated to be provisional and a demand notice was served on  him  on  26-3-1949.  He  failed  to  pay  the  assessment  though  the  time  prescribed  for  payment had .expired. The petnr. in Crim Revn. petn. No. 165 is a Soda Manufacturer and Bakery merchant at  Hosakote.  He  was  also  provisionally  assessed  to  a  tax  of  Rs.  156  for  the  year  1948-49  on  the turnover of his business. A demand notice was served upon him and he failed to pay the tax within the time allowed.

Raguhthan for Public Prosecutor - for the Crown. _:::_Judgement _:::_1.  ORDER :-This reference by the Sessions Judge of Coorg cannot be accepted for the following reasons. The irregularity that is said to have been committed by the Magistrate consisted in his failure to examine the accused under S. 249  Criminal P.C.  after a court witness was examined. This court witness supported the defence version but the trial Court did not accept the evidence of this witness. Apparently the Magistrate did not question the accused under S. 342  Criminal P.C.  as there was nothing to be explained by the accused in the evidence of the court witness who supported the defence version. So the failure to examine the accused under S. 342  in the circumstances  cannot be said to have in any way prejudiced the accused. _:::_2. In the order of reference  the learned Sessions Judge relying on the decision reported in Hooghly Chinsura Municipality v. Keshab  AIR (20) 1933 Cal 347 : (34 Cr.

The person challenging the gift deed on account of that fact must bring some more material on the record to prove the guilty _:::_intention of the donor besides the fact that he was under debt at that time. _:::_(B) Muhammadan law - Gift - Gift intended to disinherit heir is nugatory. _:::_It is the policy of the Muslim Jurists to prevent any interference with the course of devolution of property amongst the testator's heirs as laid down in the Holy Quran. The law would be the same if a certain transaction  though on the face of it a gift  is in fact a device to deprive a lawful heir of his share in the property. No person can be permitted to defeat the object of Muslim law by entering into such colourable transactions. It is an admitted principle of law that a gift intended to defeat or defraud the creditor is voidable. On the same principle a gift intended to disinherit an heir would be a sham transaction  and  therefore  nugatory. The gift in order to be effective should be a genuine transaction and not merely a plan to achieve some ulterior object. It is true that the necessary effect of almost all the gifts will be disinheritance of one or the other of the heirs of the donors  but then it should be the effect and not the real object of the gift. If the real object of the gift is disinheritance of an heir  it will be bad in law: _:::_Allah Baksh-for Appellants.

Abandonment of a part of the claim is tantamount to withdrawal of the suit in part. He will therefore be liable to pay court-fee on the part withdrawn or abandoned. We find that a similar view was taken by Shahabuddin  J.  in C. R. P. 454 of 1946. The reference is answered accordingly. _:::_Reference Answered . _:::_Reference Answered .

All simple creditors need not be brought on record in a partition suit. Order 1 R. 10  Civil P.C.  has the word ""may"" and not ""shall."" Such creditors can always file suits and get the properties of the minor plaintiffs attached before judgment if justified and allowable. The father has been adjudicated insolvent in I. P. No. 5 of 1948  and the Official Receiver  East Godavari  is defendant 5. It is alleged by the petitioners that all the debts due to these creditors are shown in the schedule prepared is the insolvency petition. So  the Official Receiver can protect the interest of all the creditors  and be is the proper person to do so. The ruling in Official Assignee  Madras v. Ramchandra Iyer  55 M. L. J. 175 : (AIR (15) 1928 Mad. 735 F. B.)  and other rulings relied on by the learned counsel for the petitioners require nothing more.

The lower Court has a discretion to add these creditors or not. It cannot be said that it erred in law or failed to exercise a jurisdiction vested in it  or acted with material irregularity or caused a material failure of justice by passing the order it did.

It has been held that under O. 23  R. 3  Civil P.C. a compromise cannot be attacked by allegations that it is a voidable compromise brought about by fraud  undue influence and duress. Provided the compromise is lawful  that is  not contrary to law  the Court is obliged to record it. The mere fact that it may be voidable is no reason for a Court refusing to record it.

Common intention _:::_should not be mixed up with ""common object"" in S.149. Both are not in any way synonymous. _:::_Similarly   the  'same""  or  ""similar""  intention  should  not  be  confused  with  common  intention.  The dividing line between the two is very thin  yet it is very material and substantial. A person in doing an act may have the same or similar intention with another person doing the same act  yet he may not have a common intention with him so as to invoke the aid of S.34  I.P.C. in convicting him. In the latter case there is always an element of pre-planning before the act is actually done between two or more persons. _:::_Since the element of intention is missing in the offence falling under S.304  Part II  the question of two or more persons having a common intention does not at all arise. It is  therefore  that S.34  I.P.C. will in no case apply to an offence falling under S.304  Part II  I  P.C. No hard and fast rules however  can be laid down as regards the application of S.34  I.P.C.  to an offence falling under Part I of S.304  I.P.C. Every case shall have to be decided on its own merits. Reading the two parts of S.304  I.P.C.  together  one is led to the irresistible conclusion that while the intention to commit the death is missing from the second part  it is very much present in the first  and when a person commits _:::_the death of another person even if he may be unavoidably driven to it  can have common intention with another person committing the death under the same compulsion. It is true that in some cases in which a person commits the death of another person  without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in an unusual manner  he may have same or similar intention with another person  but not the common intention  yet the possibility of his common intention with another person developing during the course of the event cannot altogether be excluded. _:::_Appeal Allowed .

ORDER :-Defendants 2 to 5 are the sons of defendant 1 and the plaintiffs are the sons of defendant 1's  deceased  brother.  The  plaintiffs  claimed  in  their  plaint  that  a  certain  house  belonged  to  their father  and  that  a  room  in  that  house  had  with  his  permission  been  occupied  by  the  defendants. Quarrels having arisen between the plaintiffs and the defendants  this suit was filed for the recovery of possession of that room and for an injunction to restrain the defendants from interfering with their _:::_possession of other portions of the house. The defendants claimed that they had an equal share in the house. After perusing the written statements the plaintiffs thought it desirable that a fresh suit should be instituted in which wider questions could be raised; and so made an application to the Court under O. 23  1  Civil P.C. to withdraw the suit  praying for liberty to institute a fresh suit in respect of the same subject-matter.

(a) of Cl. (4). And although the new Act does not in express terms prescribe in a separate provision any maximum period as such for which any person may in any Class or Classes be detained  it fixes  by extending the duration of the old Act till 1-4-1952  an over all time-limit beyond which preventive detention under the Act cannot be continued. These sections therefore  Sub-stantially satisfy the requirements of Sub--Cl. (b) of Cl. (4) of Art. 22  and cannot be deClared unconstitutional and void. _:::_Per Mahajan J. - Technically speaking  an amended statute remains the same statute as originally enacted but from that proposition it does not follow that the law contained in the amended statute is the same law as was contained in the original one. The law deClared by Ss. 9 and 12 of the amended statute is not the same law as was deClared by the original statute and to that extent the amended statute is in the nature of a new and independent statute. The new law admittedly standing by itself does not authorize detention of any person beyond a period of three months except in the manner provided by Art. 22 (4) of the Constitution. No question whatever arises of tacking of the period of _:::_detention under one law to the period of detention under another law  inasmuch as the detention under the earlier law automatically terminates with the repeal of S.12 of Act IV [4] of 1950. These sections  therefore  do not contravene Art. 29 (4) of the Constitution. _:::_Petitions Dismissed . ,S. Krishnan and others Petitioners v. The State of Madras and another,S.

The letter ran as follows: _:::_""I do hereby authorise you to negotiate the sale of my property  free from all encumbrances at a price not less than Rs. 1 00 000. I shall make out a good title to the property. If you succeed in securing a buyer for Rs. 1 00 000 I shall pay you Rs.1 000 as your remuneration. If the price exceeds Rs. 1  05 000 and does not exceed Rs. 1 10 000 I shall pay you the whole of the excess over Rs. 1 05 000 in addition to your remuneration of Rs. 1 000 as stated above.

In pursuance of this contract  the appellant found two persons who were ready and willing to purchase the property for Rs. 1  10 000  and by letters exchanged with them he purported to conclude a contract for the sale of the property and communicated the same to the respondent by a letter. The respondent  however  entered into an agreement with a nominee of the said persons for the sale of the property for Rs. 1  05 000 and eventually executed a conveyance in their favour. Thereupon  the appellant brought the suit alleging that the contract concluded by him with the purchasers for Rs. 1 10 000 was binding on the respondent and claimed that he was entailed to the payment of Rs. 6 000 as remuneration in accordance with the terms of his employment as he had done all that he was required to do on behalf of the respondent: _:::_Appeal Allowed .

After the disruption  the powers of the manager are not those of a surviving partner but of a co-owner or a tenant in common management. The principles of partnership law cannot be applied in their entirety to the partition of a joint family business as such and the settlement of the accounts of such business.

OVERRULED. _:::_Pen Satyanarayana Rao and Panchapagesa  Sastri  JJ. (Raghava  Rao  J. dissenting.) The object of _:::_S.  36   presidency  Towns  Insolvency  Act   1909   is  to  enable  the  Official  Assigne  e  to  gather  the necessary information as regards the whereabouts of the properties belonging to the insolvent and also to discover what all his properties are. There is no reason to confine the words any property belonging to the insolvent in Sub-s. (1) of S. 36 only to properties 'admittedly or un-disputably belonging  to him'. A person examined under S. 36 may admit to have in possession any property belonging to the insolvent  in which case sub-s. (5) of S. 36 will apply  or may dispute the insolvent's title to the same. The latter case  namely  the case where there is a dispute as regards the property in possession of the person examined under S. 36  is included within the expression ""any matter arising under S. 36"" in the proviso to S. 7 and hence the insolvency Court has jurisdiction to determine this matter only if the parties thereto agree to such a course. If the parties do not consent  the only course open to the Official Assignee is to enforce his claim by a regular suit in ordinary Courts. The decision in AIR (24) 1937 Mad 775 which holds that S. 36(5) relates only to the property admittedly belonging to the insolvent and not to the property of which the ownership is disputed and that  therefore the proviso to S. 7 does not apply where there is a dispute  is not correctly decided in view of the Full Bench decision in AIR (18) 1929 Mad 705 : Case law fully discussed; AIR (16) 1929 Mad 705 (FB)  Foll.; ILR (1938) Mad 72 : AIR (24) 1937 Mad 775 : 172 IC 346  OVERULED. _:::_Per Raghava Rao  J.- The 'matter  arising under S. 36' which is contemplated by the proviso to S. 7 is a matter arising for decision under S. 36 and thus means the matter arising for an order to be made of the kind contemplated by Sub-ss. (4) and (5) of S. 36  which is none the less a decision because made on an admission of the kind contemplated by these sub-sections in it 'secret' and not a 'litigious' proceeding. The matter arising for decision under S. 36 is a question either of possession of properly belonging to the insolvent or of the existence of a debt due to the insolvent  so that when in the former case the title of the insolvent to the property is not admitted  there is no order to be made under Sub-s. (5) of the kind which is within its purview or its intendment. The factum of disputed title to property admittedly in possession of the person examined under S. 36  puts the case outside the pale of the _:::_section and excludes it altogether from the range of any decision or order thereunder.

It must be broadcast in some recognisable way so that all men may know what it is; or  at the very least  there must be some special rule or regulation or customary channel by or through which such knowledge can be acquired with the exercise of due and reasonable diligence. In the absence therefore of any law  rule regulation or custom  a law cannot come into being by merely passing a resolution without promulgation or publication in the Gazette or other means. Promulgation or publication of some reasonable sort is essential. _:::_In this respect the difference between an Order and an Act is obvious. Acts of the Parliament are publicly  enacted.

Unless  therefore  there is acknowledgment in the required form  the payment by itself is of no avail. However  while the section requires that the payment should be made within the period of limitation  it does not require that the acknowledgment should also be made within that period. But while it is not necessary that the written acknowledgment should be made prior to the expiry of the period of limitation  it is essential that such acknowledgment whether made before or after the period of limitation must be in existence prior to the institution of the suit. Whether a suit is time barred or not has got to be determined exclusively with reference to the date on which the plaint is filed and the allegations made therein. To claim exemption under S. 20  the plaintiff must be in a position to allege and prove not only that there was payment of interest on a debt or part payment of the principal  but that such payment had been acknowledged in writing in the manner contemplated by that section. The ground of exemption is not complete without this second element  and unless both these elements are proved to exist at the date of the plaint the suit would be held to be time barred. Where none of the payments were endorsed on the bond itself and there was no acknowledgment either in the handwriting of or signed by the debtors prior to the institution of the suit  but in the written statement filed in the suit the defendants admitted the payments specified in the plaint as made on the respective dates and the written statement was signed by defendants it would not fulfil the requirements of a signed acknowledgment as is contemplated by the proviso to S. 20 : _:::_Appeal Allowed . ,Sant Lal Mahton  v.

U.P. Municipalities Act (2 of 1916)  S.298  S.318 - _:::_The  petitioner  was  carrying  on  wholesale  business  in  vegetables  in  the  municipal  limits  of  the town of Kairana in U. P. Subsequently the municipality framed certain bye-laws under S. 298  U. P.  Municipalities  Act.  Bye-law  2  provided  that  no  person  shall  establish  a  market  for  wholesale transactions in vegetables except with the permission of the Board. There was however no bye-law authorising the Board to issue the necessary licence. Further  bye-law 4 provided for the grant of a monopoly to a contractor to deal in wholesale transactions at the place fixed as a market. Acting upon this provision the Board granted a monopoly to one H to carry on the wholesale business at a place fixed as a market. The result was that the Board became powerless to grant licence to the petitioner to carry on the business within the municipal limits and it actually refused an application of he petitioner in that behalf on the ground that there was no bye-law under which the Board could grant the licence. The petitioner who was thus completely prohibited from carrying on his business filed and application under Art. 32 of the Constitution for enforcement of his fundamental right to carry on his trade guaranteed by Art. 19 (1) of the Constitution : _:::_Held  that the prohibition in bey-law 2  in the absence of any provision for issuing licence  became absolute and further the restrictions placed on the petitioner by bye-law 4 were more than reasonable restrictions as are contemplated by Art. 19 (6) and  therefore  the bye-laws would be void under Art. 13(1) of the Constitution. _:::_Held further  that though the existence of an adequate legal remedy is to be taken into consideration in the matter of granting prerogative writs  the powers given to the Supreme Court under Art. 32 are much wider and are not confined to issuing prerogative writs only. Moreover  the remedy of appeal under S. 318  U.P. Municipalities Act  was not an adequate legal remedy in the circumstances of the case.

The State of Delhi Opposite Party _:::_(A)Constitution of India  Art.19(5) - Reasonable restrictions - Meaning - Power of Court. _:::_Per Kania C. J.- Clause (5) of Art. 19 must be given its full meaning. The question which the Court has to consider is whether the restrictions put be the impugned legislation on the exercise of the right are reasonable or not. The question whether the provisions of the Act provide reasonable safeguards against the abuse of the power given to the executive authority to administer the law is not relevant _:::_for the true interpretation of the clause. The Court  on either interpretation  will entitled to consider whether the restrictions on the right to move throughout India  i. e  both as regards the territory and the duration  are reasonable or not. The law providing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by Art. 19 may contain substantive provisions as well as procedural provisions. While the reasonableness of the restrictions had to be considered with regard to the exercise of the right  it does not necessarily exclude from the consideration of the Court the question of reasonableness of the procedural part of the law. It is obvious that if the law prescribes five years externment or ten years externment  the question whether such period of externment is reasonable  being the substantive part  is necessarily for the consideration of the court under cl. (5) . Similarly  if the law provides the procedure under which the exercise of the right may be restricted  the same is also for the consideration of the Court  as it has to determine if the exercise of the right has been reasonably restricted. By this interpretation the scope and ambit of the word ""reasonable"" as applied to restrictions on the exercise of the right  is not in any way unjustifiably enlarged. It seems that the narrow constructions sought to be put on the expression  to restrict the Court's power to consider only the substantive law on the point  is not correct. _:::_Per B.K. Mukherjea J. - Though in cl. (5) the adjective 'reasonable' is predicated of the restrictions that _:::_are imposed by law and not of the law itself  that does not mean that in deciding the reasonableness or  otherwise  of  the  restrictions   the  Courts  have  to  confine  themselves  to  an  examination  of  the restrictions  in  the  abstract  with  reference  merely  to  their  duration  or  territorial  extent   and  that  it is beyond their province to look up to the circumstances under which or the manner in which the restrictions have been imposed. It is not possible to formulate an effective test which would enable the Courts to pronounce any particular restrictions to be reasonable or unreasonable per sc.All the attendant circumstances must be taken into consideration and one cannot dissociate the actual contents of the restrictions from the manner of their _:::_Petition Dismissed .

SUBBA RAO  J. :-These two connected appeals arise out of orders passed by the District Judge of Cuddappah in insolvency. The insolvent filed I. A. No. 45 of 1943 under Ss. 35 and 38. Provincial Insolvency Act. It was alleged in the petition that the insolvent proposed to satisfy the creditors at the rate of a rupee for a rupee on the amounts of the debts due to them and therefore  requested the Court to approve of his proposal and annul the adjudication. In the schedule annexed to the application the total amount of the debts was shown at Rs. 15016-0-6. The progress of this application is disclosed in the B diary. After notices were served on all the creditors  the application was posted for enquiry to 15th December 1943. Some of the creditors  respondents 2  4  5  14 and 15 filed a counter stating that they would agree only if the amounts payable under the promissory notes in their favour and interest upto the date of payment were paid. The insolvent undertook to pay like that. The learned District _:::_Judge then adjourned the application to 17th January 1944 for payment or deposit. The insolvent did not take advantage of this opportunity  and did not pay the amount within the time given. Instead  he filed applications under S. 50(2) against some creditors for expunging or reducing the debt due to them. The amount due to respondents 1  4 and 14  who did not agree to the proposal  was more than one-fourth in value of the total amount of the debt due by the insolvent. The learned District Judge  therefore  dismissed the application filed under Ss. 35 and 38  Provincial Insolvency Act  as also the applications filed under S. 50(2) on the ground that they were not maintainable in view of his dismissal of the main application. The insolvent has preferred C. M. A.

Kishan Singh Hira Sing Respondent _:::_Specific Relief Act (1 of 1877)  S.42 - Suit for mere declaration - Plaintiff not entitled to relief of possession at time of suit-Right accruing during pendency - Suit if should be thrown out. _:::_The proposition cannot be denied that a Court can take notice of events that appear after the institution of the suit and determine the dispute between the parties in the light of the changed circumstances  but it cannot follow as an inevitable corollary that a suit which was perfectly in order when it was instituted would become bad on account of the happening of events subsequently. The ordinary rule _:::_of law is that the rights of the parties must be adjudicated upon as they stand on the date the plaintiff comes into Court with his claim. This rule  however  may be deviated from and the plaintiff required to mould his prayer for relief in the light of the altered circumstances when the Court feels it incumbent and necessary to take notice of events that have cropped up after the suit was instituted. Such deviation would be justified where the litigation would be shortened or full justice between the parties would be done by resorting to it. _:::_The expression 'omits to do so' in the proviso to S. 42 apparently refers to the ability of the plaintiff on the date of the institution of the suit and cannot be stretched to include subsequently acquired ability also. The right to claim a declaratory decree does not lapse as soon as the right to seek consequential relief comes into existence after the institution of the suit. _:::_Where the plaintiff instituted a suit for a mere declaration that certain gifts by the widow were void qua his reversionary rights and he could not at the time of the institution of the suit ask for the consequential relit of possession  the fact that the widow dies during the pendency of the suit giving rise to the right of the plaintiff to claim possession  would not entitle the Court to throw out the suit on the ground that no consequential relief for possession was asked for: 65 P.

Defendant 2 in his statement filed on 7th July 1948 which was filed in person had stated that he had executed _:::_on 25th December 1945 an agreement to sell on a stamped paper and had taken Rs. 212 cash from defendant 1 to make up the purchase amount. Though the properties were previously in the possession of defendant 1  defendant 2 had delivered possession again as per the agreement to sell and also made an arrangement to take the agreement to sell as a sale-deed till he executed a registered sale-deed on a properly stamped paper. He also pleaded that even though defendant 2 informed the plaintiff about the agreement to sell in favour of defendant 1 the plaintiff had encouraged him by saying that he would give the surplus money and persuaded him to execute the sale-deed in favour of the plaintiff. On 3rd January 1949 defendant 2 filed I. A.

Upon a petition by some of the parties to the suit  who made certain allegations of maladministration  the appellant was removed from his receivership by the Subordinate Judge of Tellicherry and two others were appointed in his stead. A preliminary point argued in the appeal is whether the appeal is maintainable. _:::_2. We have no doubt that the law in most High Courts  including this High Court  is that no appeal lies against an order removing a receiver. The matter came up directly for decision in C.M.A. No. 278 of 1944 before a Bench of this Court; and it was held that in the absence of any special provision in the Code for an appeal against an order removing a receiver  no appeal would lie. The learned Judges purported to follow Ramaswami Naidu v. Ayyalu Naidu  46 MLJ 196 : (AIR (11) 1924 Mad 614)  although the question that same up for decision in that appeal was whether any appeal lay against an order refusing to remove a receiver. If an order removing a receiver were appealable  then an order refusing to remove a receiver would also be appealable and vice versa. Even if this matter were res integra  we should be of opinion that no appeal lies against the order removing a receiver; for S. 104  _:::_Appeal Dismissed . ,"Kutteer Vengayil - Rayarappan Nayanar, Karnavan of Kutteer Vengayil Tarwad Appellants v.

The proposition equally applies to an admission in a signed pleading and under the provisions of the Evidence Act an _:::_admission or affidavit made by a party in a prior litigation would be regarded as an admission in a subsequent action though it is' capable of rebuttal. _:::_Evidently it is 'for the maker of the admission to come into the witness-box where the objection is taken at the very early stages and explain as to what led him to make this admission. In the absence of any such explanation  the value of this admission is rather enhanced. _:::_Per Teja Singh C. J. - The effect of Ss. 21 and 31 is that when an admission is proved against a party a presumption arises that the matters to which the admission relates are true and the burden of proving that they are not true lies upon the person who made the admission.

(5 of 1898)  S.206  S.209  S.213 - Powers of committal Court - Magistrate to weigh evidence - He can look into depositions of prosecution witnesses as also defence witnesses - If upon reasonable view conviction is possible case must be committed. _:::_The law regarding the powers of a committal Court is now well settled  and may be summed up in the following five propositions : (1). The Magistrate conducting the enquiry is not a machine or a mere _:::_post office to see whether there is any evidence against the accused or any of them. He is not bound to commit all those against whom any prosecution witness speaks regarding the offence  whether he is believed or not. _:::_He has to satisfy himself that there are sufficient grounds for committing the accused for trial by a Court of Session  and it is his right and duty to weigh the evidence from that point of view. (2). He can  for that purpose  look not only into the depositions of the prosecution witnesses but also into the depositions of the defence with cases examination behalf of the accused. (3) Section 209 does not bar a Magistrate from using his own knowledge and experience of men and affairs in judging and in weighing the evidence before him. (4) But he judges and weighs the evidence for the purpose of deciding whether the evidence is such as a Judge or jury could reasonably be asked to make it the basis of a  conviction. If he comes to the conclusion that it is  it is his clear duty to commit. But  if he comes to the confusion that the evidence before him is such that no Judge or jury can possibly believe it  he has got the power  and  indeed  it is his duty  to discharge the accused. If he finds that the evidence against the accused is totally unworthy  and that there are facts on the record which show that no offence in fact was committed  or that one of the offences charged was not committed  or that any one of the accused is clearly shown to have not taken any part in the offence  he must discharge the accused covered by those conclusions. Of course  if his conclusions are manifestly wrong  and not _:::_merely one of two possible views  his order can be set aside in revision. (5) But if  upon any reasonable view of the evidence  a conviction is possible  the case must be committed  and a Magistrate is not empowered to give the benefit of the doubt to an accused person in committal proceedings. [Applying the above tests it was held that the accused ought to have been committed  and that the Magistrate had no business to discharge him]. _:::_(B)Evidence  Act  (1  of  1872)   S.114  -  Unexplained  possession  of  jewel  of  murdered  person  - Possession not possible without murder - It is evidence regarding murder. _:::_Petition Dismissed . ,In re Guli Venkataswami Petitioner,In re Guli Venkataswami,petitioner,NIL,respondent,"['PANCHAPAKESA AYYAR , J.']",MADRAS HIGH COURT (Principal Seat at MADRAS),1949-11-16,Petition Dismissed,upheld

To say that ""such an officer will draw a pay of Rs. 250"" does not mean that he has been given a right to demand that pay.
